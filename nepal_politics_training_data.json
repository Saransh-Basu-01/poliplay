    "content": "Greetings! This is Today in Slovakia – Thursday, 24 July edition.\n\n As legal debates swirl over who qualifies for political rights in Slovakia, over 130 students from 31 countries are set to arrive in Bratislava to do something more fundamental: learn the Slovak language itself. The 61st edition of Studia Academica Slovaca, the country’s flagship summer school for Slovak language and culture, kicks off on 28 July at Comenius University.\n\nParticipants hail from across Europe, Asia, and the Americas — from France and Finland to Japan, Iran, and the USA. The programme includes everything from grammar drills and translation seminars to folk music workshops and weekend excursions across Slovakia’s cultural landmarks. It is Slovakia’s language diplomacy in action — and a reminder that interest in Slovak identity runs far beyond its borders. \n\nSave the date: On 14 August at 16:00 in Moyzes Hall, students will present their creative work in Sami sebe — an afternoon of theatre, dance, music, and more. Come support them!\n\nWho really gets a say in Slovak politics?\n\nSlovakia’s public defender of rights, Róbert Dobrovodský, has reignited a constitutional debate over who gets to participate in the country’s political life. Last week, he filed two major objections to the current Political Parties Act. \n\nThe crux: Under current Slovak law, citizens without permanent residence in the country are barred from key political rights, such as joining or founding a political party, voting in party organs, or being elected to party leadership. Dobrovodský calls this unconstitutional, and legal experts are backing him up.\n\nThe kicker: Citizens of other EU countries who do hold permanent residence in Slovakia have those rights. “That gives foreign nationals a higher political standing than Slovaks living abroad,” Dobrovodský argued. “It’s legally and morally indefensible.”\n\nExpert backing: Constitutional lawyer Vincent Bujňák says the ombudsman’s objections are not only valid but urgent: “The Constitution guarantees political rights to all citizens. Limitations can only exist if they are absolutely necessary in a democratic society — for national security or public order. This fails that test.” (Rádio Slovensko)\n\nBy the numbers: That means a Slovak citizen living in Rajka or Kittsee — towns just over the Austrian and Hungarian borders, home to many daily commuters — can vote in national elections, but cannot join a political party or help found one. Paradox? Absolutely.\n\nDISABILITY DISCRIMINATION TOO? Dobrovodský also flagged a second clause, which limits political rights to those with full legal capacity — effectively excluding some people with disabilities, regardless of their individual circumstances. He argues that this violates not just the Slovak Constitution, but also international conventions Slovakia has signed.\n\nMinister will listen: Interior Minister Matúš Šutaj Eštok (Hlas) has taken note. His ministry — which is behind the current draft amendment — says it plans to meet with Dobrovodský’s office once the comment process concludes. “We’ll assess all the comments seriously,” Šutaj Eštok told Rádio Slovensko. “All reasonable proposals will be taken into account. That’s how this process works.”\n\nBut that’s not all... The proposed Interior Ministry amendment also includes: \n\nRaising the election threshold for public party financing to 5 percent Locking party names and acronyms for five years Increasing the election deposit for candidates\n\nIf approved, these changes would take effect in the next electoral cycle.\n\nMORE STORIES FROM THE SLOVAK SPECTATOR \n\nLANDLOCKED, NOT ISOLATED: Experts say even landlocked countries need smart maritime strategies — and for Slovakia, that means building faster rail links to seaports like Koper, Trieste, and Gdańsk.

She believes meaningful HR starts with understanding people’s real needs. \n\nSCOOTERGATE \n\nTabak takes a tumble \n\nThere are rules, and then there are Bolt’s rules. And as former MP Romana Tabaková — a figure often mocked and criticised for her controversial statements on LGBT+ issues and her penchant for swimming in off-limits places — just found out, breaking them will get you kicked off — scooter and all.\n\nWhat happened: A photo surfaced last week showing Tabak riding a shared Bolt e-scooter through central Bratislava with her little son onboard — a clear breach of the platform’s safety policy, which forbids tandem riding.\n\nBolt’s response: Decisive and unflinching. Her user account was deactivated, citing internal rules aimed at keeping the service “safe and responsible” for everyone.\n\nTabak’s reaction: Contrite — sort of. Posting Bolt’s message to her social channels, she added: “Thank you for caring about safety, I won’t do it again.”\n\nBut one note of caution: Let’s just hope Bolt applies those same rules across the board — not just when the violator ends up on satirical websites.\n\nAnd a footnote in brand loyalty: In response to the ban, Tabaková declared she would be switching to Hopin instead. One small catch: Hopin does not operate e-scooters. Let’s hope she knows.\n\nIN OTHER NEWS \n\nThe Ukrainian behind last year’s wave of bomb threats targeting Slovak and Czech schools was reportedly a minor at the time, raising questions over whether he can be criminally prosecuted, according to Ukrainian police. Czech weekly Respekt reports that money linked to his actions came from a Russian bank account. In June, 126,827 foreigners were employed in Slovakia, with less than a third from EU or EEA countries. Most came from third countries, notably Ukraine, Serbia, and India, but also from Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Indonesia, Georgia, Nepal and the Philippines.The Railway Workers Union has dropped its strike alert after clinching a deal with state rail operator ŽSR. After months of drawn-out talks, workers will see a 4.8 percent pay rise (up to class 12), a €45 monthly bump for higher grades — and a €400 Railway Day bonus. (TASR) Progressive Slovakia (PS) tops the latest AKO poll with 22.1 percent, ahead of Smer (19.4 percent) and Hlas (12.4 percent). The current coalition falls short of a majority — even with far-right Republika in tow — landing on just 71 MPs. Meanwhile, the opposition bloc (PS, SaS, KDH) would need to bring the Slovensko movement on board to tip the scales in parliament. A fragmented field and tight margins keep coalition maths anything but straightforward. Slovakia’s e-commerce market grew 4 percent year-on-year in Q2, bouncing back from a sluggish April with a strong June, thanks to holiday spending, according to Heureka’s E-commerce Insider. The breakout hit? Smart rings, with a staggering 920 percent surge, alongside spikes in erotic gadgets (+876 percent), memory supplements (+703 percent), and travel cribs. On the flip side, sofas, 3D puzzles, and webcams tanked — victims of last year’s boom. Average spend held at €73, and customer satisfaction soared to 95.3 percent. Not quite Czech-level growth (+8 percent), but still holding steady. (SITA) \n\nFinancial literacy in Slovakia is creeping upwards, but still lags behind much of Europe. Just 48 percent of Slovaks are financially literate, putting the country below neighbours like the Czech Republic, Austria and Hungary, according to ECB data. The Nordics lead the pack, thanks in part to financial education baked into school curricula. Slovaks remain cautious with money — real estate over stocks, savings over risk — and only a third actively invest. (SITA)Opposition parties SaS, PS, and KDH are teaming up to form a special commission in parliament to scrutinise the government’s plan to build a new nuclear power plant with Westinghouse. SaS MP Karol Galek says all MPs are welcome, with the proposal set to hit the economic affairs committee in September. Meanwhile, other opposition groups are plotting their own moves — from roundtables to calls for Fico to face the parliament.

    "title": "Why Karnataka court halted deportation of cave-dwelling Russian woman, her kids",
    "content": "The Karnataka High Court has stayed the deportation of Nina Kutina, a Russian woman who was found living in a cave near Gokarna with her two young daughters this month. The court's decision comes after a writ petition by Kutina's lawyer, Beena Pillai, challenged the deportation order. She argued that authorities had ignored the children's rights under Article 3 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. Under this article, the best interests of the child must be a top priority in all decisions and actions that affect children. Agreeing, Justice S Sunil Dutt Yadav noted that deporting Kutina could endanger her children's welfare and safety. During the hearing, the Assistant Solicitor General also admitted that the children did not have valid travel or identity documents. In response, the court stated that without adequate documents, any attempt to deport the children was unreasonable at this time. The court has now asked the government to file an affidavit within two weeks confirming the absence of valid documents for the children. It has also directed that no deportation should take place without its permission until further orders. The matter will be heard again on August 18. Kutina's journey started in 2016 when she came to India on a business visa. She overstayed her visa and became involved with spiritual communities in Goa. In 2017, she began dating Dror Goldstein, an Israeli man, but the following year, Kutina was deported to Russia for overstaying her visa. In 2020, she returned to India. In 2023, she faced a personal tragedy when her son died in a motorcycle accident. After this personal loss, she grew increasingly reclusive. Goldstein told reporters that although their relationship broke down, he continued to send her a good amount of money each month, but she shut off communication. After renewing his visa, he came back from Nepal to find that Kutina and their daughters were gone. He filed a police report in December, but he didn't hear anything for months. Then, this July, reports surfaced that they had been found in a cave in Gokarna. When questioned about her decision, Kutina told officers she was searching for spiritual solitude and to live closer to nature. She also dismissed concerns about living in the forest, claiming animals and snakes are our friends. After they were relocated, Kutina messaged a friend, saying they had been taken from their big...beautiful cave and placed in a prison without sky, without grass...with an icy hard floor. M Narayana, Superintendent of Police, described her as deeply disillusioned with human society.",

    "content": "China is calling to accelerate a trans-Himalayan network project to connect it with Nepal as Beijing works to draw its Himalayan neighbour closer – a development that may raise concerns from regional rival India.\nThe head of China International Development Cooperation Agency, Chen Xiaodong, said, “[China] is willing to strengthen the alignment of development cooperation strategies with Nepal and accelerate the construction of a trans-Himalayan multidimensional connectivity network”.\nChen was speaking during a three-day visit to Nepal that ended on Tuesday.\n\n“[We] should implement more projects in areas such as agriculture, new energy, health and education to promote Nepal’s economic and social development and improve people’s livelihoods,” Chen was quoted saying in a statement published on the agency’s WeChat account on Wednesday.\nChen’s visit comes as China has managed to repair ties with its regional rival India after a tense relationship following a border clash in 2020, and as it competes for influence in the region to win over partners such as Nepal.\nLandlocked Nepal sits between India and China, with India traditionally seen as Nepal’s main ally because of their shared culture and proximity\nHowever, it has been drawn closer to China in recent years because of Beijing’s infrastructure investment. China has in recent years boosted economic interactions with the Himalayan nation by pumping millions of dollars into projects, ranging from roads to hydropower plants.\nChen’s trip followed a visit by Nepali Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli’s visit to China in December, his first overseas trip in the role, which marked a departure from the tradition of visiting New Delhi first.\nThe trans-Himalayan multidimensional connectivity network is seen as part of the massive package of infrastructure and communication to connect the two nations after Nepal signed up to Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative in 2017.\nDuring a visit to Nepal in 2019 by Chinese President Xi Jinping, Beijing signed bilateral deals to improve infrastructure connectivity, including for the US$8 billion cross-border railway from Shigatse – also called Xigaze – in south Tibet to the Nepalese capital, Kathmandu.\nThe rail project has been opposed by India amid rising competition with China for strategic influence in the Himalayas, while Nepal agreed to fast-track a rail connection from Kathmandu to the Indian mainland in 2020.\n\nDuring Oli’s visit to China, both sides agreed to speed up the feasibility study of the cross-border railway and that Beijing would also train talent in the rail sector.\nIn 2023, China opened Lizi Port, a trading facility at a Tibetan village at the border in Yagra, Zhongba county, in Shigatse prefecture. It aims to become a trading hub with Nepal.\nThe port will be the fourth trading channel to open along the 1,400km China-Nepal border.",

    "title": "High Court halts deportation of Russian woman, her children found in Gokarna cave",
    "content": "The Karnataka High Court has stayed the deportation of the children of the Russian woman who was recently found living with her two daughters in a cave in Gokarna, citing the need to prioritise their best interests as mandated by the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC).The court’s interim order puts a temporary halt on any unilateral action by authorities.The decision of Justice S Sunil Dutt Yadav came during the hearing of a writ petition that was filed to challenge a sudden deportation order issued against the children. The petitioner, represented by advocate Beena Pillai, argued that the deportation process disregarded the children's welfare and violated UNCRC principles.The petition was filed on behalf of Kutina’s daughter, Prema (6) and Ama (4), who were rescued last week along with their mother by the Gokarna police during a routine patrol in the remote, landslide-prone Ramatirtha Hills. The family had been living in isolation, reportedly as part of Kutina’s spiritual journey, when officials discovered them.During the hearing, the Assistant Solicitor General appeared for the Union of India, while Advocate Beena Pillai represented the petitioner. The court noted that a detailed hearing is required in the matter. Based on the Centre’s submission that the children do not currently possess valid travel documents, the court said the fear of immediate deportation is not reasonable at this stage.It directed the Centre to file its objections in writing within two weeks and made it clear that no deportation steps can be taken without first approaching the bench. Deportation, if any, cannot proceed without prior intimation to the court until the next hearing on August 18, 2025.Kutina had originally entered India on a business visa in 2016, which expired in 2017. Authorities say she re-entered India in 2018 after travelling to Nepal, and that multiple visa violations have since occurred. Her passport was recovered during a joint search operation by the police and forest department.Following the rescue, the family was shifted first to an ashram and later to a government women’s shelter in Karwar.- EndsPublished By: Deepthi Published On: Jul 24, 2025Tune InMust Watch",

    "title": "USA Cricket battles for its future amid power struggle with private consortium ACE",
    "content": "In 2019, USA Cricket handed over the keys to its future. American Cricket Enterprise Inc. (ACE), a private consortium co-founded by Sameer Mehta, Satyan Gajwani, Vijay Srinivasan, and Vineet Jain, secured exclusive 50-year rights to run elite T20 cricket in the United States of America. According to the Term Sheet signed between both parties, ACE promised to bankroll national teams, build six stadiums, and launch professional leagues that would make cricket America’s next major sport. \n\nAlso read: U.S. is starting to embrace cricket, says top American diplomat\n\nOn the field, that dream seems within reach. In 2024, the USA — an Associate Member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) — co-hosted the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup. The national team exceeded expectations by defeating Pakistan and advancing to the Super 8s. Recognising this achievement, USA Cricket was honoured with the ICC Associate Member Men’s Team Performance of the Year award at the recently held ICC Annual Conference in Singapore. \n\nBut off the field, the story has been far less harmonious. With the Olympics approaching and cricket newly added to the Los Angeles 2028 Summer Olympics (LA28) slate, that vision is fracturing. \n\nA year ago, the ICC placed USA Cricket “on notice”, and following the recent AGM, the global governing body reiterated: “The organisation remains on notice (USAC). USAC is required to undertake comprehensive governance reforms, including but not limited to completing free and fair elections within a three-month period.” \n\nA contractual dispute between ACE and USA Cricket threatens the board’s Olympic certification, its standing with the ICC, and its authority over the very game it is meant to govern. \n\nIn a breach notice issued on June 23 this year, USA Cricket stated that ACE had violated major contractual terms: delayed payments, missed infrastructure deadlines, governance interference, and international overreach. ACE, in turn, denied wrongdoing, claiming that USA Cricket had mischaracterised the Term Sheet and had failed to meet its own obligations. \n\nWhy this deal was always different \n\nIn most mature U.S. sports, national team governance is insulated from professional league control. Take basketball, for example. USA Basketball, a non-profit governing body, runs the Olympic programme, while the NBA’s privately owned franchises manage the commercial league. The NBA does not own or fund USA Basketball; cooperation typically means player release and scheduling alignment, not a financial lifeline. \n\nBut USA Cricket’s 2019 agreement flipped that script. ACE was granted sweeping control: full commercial rights, infrastructure responsibilities, and funding obligations for elite cricket — all in one bundled deal. In return, USA Cricket would receive a 5% share of all cricket revenues and guaranteed minimum payments. \n\nThat dependency — rare in American sports — now sits at the heart of a governance crisis. \n\nA billion-dollar deal under review \n\nUSA Cricket’s June breach notice charged ACE with several failures. A close examination of the Term Sheet, ACE’s July 8 rebuttal, and supporting legal documents reveals the following: \n\nAlleged breaches \n\nStadium delivery failure: The contract required six ICC-standard stadiums by 2024 (later extended by a year due to COVID-19). Only one (Grand Prairie, Texas) is complete, and ACE has shifted the responsibility of building infrastructure to MLC franchises without USA Cricket’s written consent. Section 24 of the Term Sheet states: “Except in the event of a transfer to an affiliate, the Agreement, including USA Cricket’s exclusive license for Major and Minor Leagues, is transferable or assignable to another party only with the written consent of USA Cricket.” \n\nThe Morrisville, Lauderhill, and Oakland stadiums are not owned or exclusively operated by ACE, and it has pushed the completion timelines to 2028, well outside the agreed timeline in the Term Sheet. The Term Sheet states in Section 5.1 that ACE must “make commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the stadiums will be operational by no later than 2024” and that it must control “all stadium events and activities”. \n\nRevenue share dilution: The Term Sheet entitles USA Cricket to 5% of all gross cricket-related revenues. ACE’s plan to devolve local sponsorships and media deals to franchises (starting 2027) risks shrinking that pool — and with it, USA Cricket’s share. \n\nUnapproved expansion: ACE’s push for a Toronto-based franchise and a strategic tie-up with New Zealand Cricket was initiated without USA Cricket’s sign-off. The March 2025 ICC sanctioning standards require that when an event is staged in one federation’s jurisdiction but played (in whole or part) in another’s territory, both national bodies must sign off. USA Cricket says no such approval was sought for ACE’s plans outside the U.S. \n\nACE’s response to this is that the events have not occurred yet and that it will comply with the ICC rules, if and when they do. \n\nPlayer/staff salary shortfall: USA Cricket cited a $606,189 (player and staff payment for a period of July 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024) and a $647,603 (January 1, 2025 to June 23, 2025) payment lapse. ACE responded with records showing $1.43 million paid in 2024 to players, coaches, and staff eligible for U.S. national teams. \n\nACE calculated the payment made based on the MLC Draft salary paid by franchisees to U.S. domestic players according to Term 3.3: “… The amounts, structure and format of the contracts for the players, coaches and support staff will be the sole discretion of ACE, or the JV, as applicable” and 3.4 which states: “All contracts for professional players for the Major League will include the ability for the players to represent the USA National teams, subject to the players’ selection for such representation.” \n\nBut USA Cricket has objected to ACE’s position that “the entirety of a salary paid to an MLC player can or should be offset against ACE’s obligations under the Term Sheet” and has accused ACE of “essentially using USA Cricket to fund its MLC player salaries”. \n\nViewed from an Indian or IPL context, ACE’s argument would essentially mean Indian Test captain Shubman Gill’s annual BCCI central contract of ₹5 crore and his match fees should be offset against his Gujarat Titans IPL salary of ₹16.5 crore. \n\nNo High-Performance Centre?: Though promised by 2020, ACE maintains that the Grand Prairie venue currently serves that role. However, sources within USA Cricket say that the stadium does not meet the definition or minimum infrastructure standards of a fully operational High-Performance Centre, and that it was not developed in genuine consultation with USA Cricket, despite claims to the contrary. \n\nNo Minor League Cricket (MiLC) in 2025: The Term Sheet allows ACE to run Minor League Cricket but does not mandate it annually. So far, the League has seen four seasons since 2021. And while USA Cricket acknowledges that the Term Sheet includes the launch of MiLC, “it feels the spirit and intent of the agreement clearly require the sustainable and continuous operation of developmental competitions”. ACE is yet to announce dates for the MiLC 2025 calendar.\n\nWhile there is no documentation available with this publication to support USA Cricket’s claims that ACE meddled in athlete elections or team selection, USA Cricket insists that “the application of ACE’s ‘good faith discretion’ under the Term Sheet is being misused to influence national team selections, specifically by promoting the inclusion of MLC-contracted players who meet only the minimum ICC domicile criteria”. \n\nUSA Cricket’s own finances: a house built on sand \n\nThe financial squeeze behind the confrontation is visible on the balance sheet. USA Cricket ended 2023 with just $52,533 in cash against $615,110 in current liabilities. Receivables swelled to $505,689, and disclosures show $439,000 of that tied to ACE. When the governing body’s short-term survival depends on collecting from the same private partner it accuses of breach, leverage runs one way. The audit also reports continuing negative operating cash flow, reinforcing how quickly funding gaps can become existential. \n\n“… the organisation had a net asset deficiency, negative cash flows from operating activities, and total current liabilities exceeding total current assets. The ability… to continue as a going concern is dependent upon management’s plan,” the USA Cricket auditors noted. \n\nThe note further stated that USA Cricket’s ability to operate depends on continued grants from the ICC and advances/contract revenue from ACE, precisely the entities whose payments and performance are now in dispute. In the same filing, USA Cricket disclosed that 48% of its 2023 contributions came from the ICC and 12% from ACE, underscoring how concentrated that lifeline is. \n\nConflict of interest \n\nInternal emails also reveal that Paraag Marathe, the USA Cricket Chairman between 2018 and 2022, held a consulting agreement with Times Internet (UK) — a key ACE backer and Willow TV (the only 24x7 live cricket channel in the USA and the official broadcaster for MLC) owner — while the Term Sheet was being finalised in 2019. He reportedly disclosed it only in late 2021. \n\nThe letter from the USA Cricket counsel states: “Under this agreement, Mr. Marathe is to provide general consulting services to Times Internet (UK) Limited related to (1) sponsorship opportunities in the mainstream U.S. sports advertising space, (2) growing Times Internet (UK) Limited’s business, and (3) media rights and distribution opportunities for Willow TV. Although the financial terms of this agreement and the agreement with ACE are redacted, Mr. Marathe informs me that the financial payment from the Times Internet (UK) Limited agreement is approximately 5% of the payments owed under the ACE agreement.” \n\nMarathe is no minor player in the U.S. sports world. He serves as President of 49ers Enterprises and Executive Vice-President of Football Operations for the San Francisco 49ers, and chairs Leeds United in England.\n\nIn a communication between USA Cricket and its attorney, which this publication has seen, legal counsel warned in 2021 that while the arrangement might not technically breach USA Cricket policy, it created a strong perception problem and urged Marathe to recuse himself from decisions involving Times Internet (UK). \n\nIn a legal advisory to USA Cricket, board counsel wrote: “Although I don’t believe that the agreement causes Mr. Marathe to have a direct conflict of interest under USA Cricket’s Conflict of Interest Policy, there is still a need under the policy to avoid the perception of, or potential for, a conflict. \n\n“Therefore… my advice would be: Mr. Marathe should excuse himself from any formal or informal discussions related to the relationship between USA Cricket and Times Internet (UK) Limited and/or Willow TV, and should take no part in any discussion or vote… If there is any question or dispute… the CEO of USA Cricket should determine whether Mr. Marathe should be excused…” \n\nThe Term Sheet, drawn up when Marathe was Chairman of ACE, vests ACE with extraordinary power: \n\nSection 13 (Audit rights): USAC can audit ACE only once annually via a mutually agreed third party — a clause so restrictive that meaningful financial oversight becomes impractical. \n\nSections 3, 5, 24 (Infrastructure): ACE can assign infrastructure obligations to affiliates without new consent. \n\nSections 4-9 (League decisions): All commercial, format, and expansion decisions rest with ACE, not USAC. \n\nSection 22 (Termination): ACE faces no penalty for withholding payments while disputes are unresolved. USAC’s termination rights require long “cure” windows, delaying enforcement. \n\nThis arrangement flies in the face of standard U.S. sports governance, where the National Governing Bodies (NGB), for example, USA Basketball, maintain independence from league operators like the NBA. It is a level of authority rarely seen in U.S. sports partnerships. While this model helped fast-track professional cricket in the U.S., it also left USA Cricket heavily reliant on one private partner, with limited audit rights and few enforcement mechanisms if disputes arise. \n\nThat dependency has amplified the pressure on USA Cricket to strengthen its governance framework. Under the revised constitution, updated in line with U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC) guidelines, the board has expanded from 10 to 12 directors, with two additional seats allocated to player representatives — increasing their total to four. \n\nThe last elections were held in a staggered manner — independent directors in February 2024, player directors as far back as August 2022, and membership directors in July 2023. \n\nAs per the official USA Cricket website, the board currently has 10 seats, with three vacant. Both player directors — Nadia T. Gruny and Srini Salver — have terms that ended in 2024, while Chairman Venu Pisike’s term runs until December 31, 2025. \n\nTo be part of the Olympic system, USA Cricket must also meet the USOPC standards: independent governance, enforceable conflict of interest rules, financial transparency, and a board in which “athlete representatives will equal at least 33.3% of all NGB boards of directors, executive boards, and other governing boards”. \n\nJust before the ICC AGM, an ESPNcricinfo report suggested that the ICC had proposed a full resignation of the USA Cricket board as part of the road map for Olympic certification. However, the majority of board members have declined to resign, stating that it was only one of the three options suggested by the USOPC. \n\nIn March this year, three former directors — Patricia Whittaker, Kuljit Singh Nijjar, and Arjun Rao Gona — removed from the board in December 2024, joined current director Atul Rai in suing the organisation and six sitting directors individually, alleging wrongful termination, governance lapses, and retaliation. \n\nCan USA Cricket still govern the sport? Without independent control, strong audit rights, or leverage over its own revenues, USA Cricket risks failing its core mandate. The consequences go beyond league disputes — the board’s very legitimacy, and its Olympic future, may hang in the balance. \n\nOlympic stakes: USOPC certification risk \n\nCricket’s inclusion at the Los Angeles 2028 Olympics gives this dispute regulatory teeth. In 2023, cricket was among five new sports approved for the LA28 programme by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), driven in part by the vast audience the game commands in the Indian subcontinent. As host, the United States is expected to field both men’s and women’s teams in a six-team medal competition. \n\nThe stakes were underscored in June 2024 when the U.S. co-hosted the men’s T20 World Cup, staging matches across three venues — high-visibility proof of market potential ahead of LA28. \n\nUSA Cricket is an Associate Member of the ICC, not a Full Member — a status that comes with limited voting power and funding and that places a premium on demonstrating robust governance and development pathways to progress within the ICC system. \n\nSimply put, the structure of USA Cricket’s deal with ACE risks putting it in violation of several governance standards laid out by the USOPC, the ICC, and the Ted Stevens Act — the U.S. law that defines the framework for NGBs and their relationship with the USOPC. \n\nAutonomy undermined \n\nSection 220522.5 of the Ted Stevens Act demands that an NGB “demonstrates that it is autonomous in the governance of its sport, except with respect to the oversight of the organisation, in that it — (A) independently decides and controls all matters central to governance; (B) does not delegate decision-making and control of matters central to governance; and (C) is free from outside restraint.” \n\nBut USA Cricket’s core operations — funding, league structure, infrastructure, scheduling — are controlled by ACE as per the Term Sheet (Sections 3, 4, 5, 22). USA Cricket’s own audited financials show dependency on ACE advances to stay afloat — a breach of both spirit and letter. \n\nCode of conduct concerns \n\nUnder 8.4.1 (a) (vi, vii) of the USOPC Bylaws, an NGB must “adopt and enforce a code of conduct for its employees, members, board of directors, and officers, including clear conflicts of interest principles, and adopt and enforce ethics policies and procedures”. \n\nUSA Cricket’s legal counsel at that time acknowledged that then-chair Marathe had a concurrent consulting contract with Times Internet (UK). \n\nUSA Cricket and Marathe’s failure to disclose the above fact or recuse Maratheduring the 2019 deal-making phase violates the “enforceability” requirement of the USOPC. \n\nLack of financial transparency \n\nThe USOPC Bylaw 8.4.1 (b), which lays down “Financial Standards and Reporting Practices” as part of Certification Standards for National Governing Bodies, requires every NGB to “(i) demonstrate financial operational capability to administer its sport; (ii) be financially and operationally transparent and accountable to its members and to the corporation [the USOPC]; (iii) adopt a budget and maintain accurate accounting records in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP); (iv) submit its complete IRS Form 990 and audited financial statements, including management letter and budget, to the corporation annually; (v) post on its website its current bylaws and other organic documents, its IRS form 990 for the three most recent years, and its audited financial statements for the three most recent years; (vi) satisfy such other requirements as are set forth by the corporation”. \n\nThe Term Sheet’s Section 13 restricts USA Cricket’s audit rights. It says USA Cricket must negotiate and agree upon a mutually acceptable auditor, with rights limited to one annual review. Any dispute triggers a costly arbitration mechanism, making full oversight impractical and opaque. \n\nICC’s ‘no government (or other public or quasi-public body) interference’ rule \n\nAccording to article 2.4, clause D of the ICC Memorandum & Articles of Association, each member must at all times “manage its affairs autonomously and ensure that there is no government (or other public or quasi-public body) interference in its governance, regulation and/or administration of Cricket in its Cricket Playing Country (including in operational matters, in the selection and management of teams, and in the appointment of coaches or support personnel)“. \n\nGiven that ACE controls the MLC and MiLC structure, funds national team salaries and venues, owns revenue-generating rights, and can withhold payments based on its sole discretion, the ICC could classify ACE’s position as private interference, potentially triggering a review or suspension, especially with Olympic certification on the line. \n\nHow cricket boards are structured globally \n\nMost national cricket bodies operate as independent member associations or non-profit federations that administer domestic competitions, select national teams, and interface with the ICC. \n\nWhile governments may provide funding, security, or stadium support, the ICC requires that boards “manage their affairs autonomously” and ensure “no government (or other public or quasi-public body) interference” in governance or administration. \n\nRecent examples of ICC action \n\nThe ICC typically penalises boards for governance failures tied to government interference. USA Cricket’s case is unusual, stemming from private overreach, but the principle of autonomy remains the same. \n\nSri Lanka (2023): Sri Lanka Cricket was suspended on November 10, 2023, for failing to “manage its affairs autonomously” and allowing government interference. The ICC lifted the ban in early 2024, saying it was satisfied SLC had restored compliance with membership obligations. \n\nZimbabwe (2019): ICC froze funding and barred the team after a government commission took control of Zimbabwe Cricket. It was reinstated once governance conditions were met. \n\nNepal (2016): The Cricket Association of Nepal was suspended following government involvement and disputed elections, and was readmitted on a conditional basis after reforms were effected and elections held in 2019. \n\nThese cases underline the risk for USA Cricket; while many countries are penalised for state interference, the U.S. challenge is almost the mirror opposite — private overreach concentrated in a long-term commercial partner. If autonomy is the test, the form of control should matter less to the ICC than the fact of it. \n\nThe ICC has begun taking steps to “reset” and overhaul the leadership and governance structures of USA Cricket, following concerns raised by the USOPC about whether USA Cricket meets the independence and athlete-representation standards required for Olympic recognition. \n\nIs it conceivable that a sport is introduced in the Olympics without the host country fielding a team in the event? History’s answer is intriguing. Cricket debuted, as a one-off, in the Paris Summer Olympics in 1900. Great Britain, represented by the Devon and Somerset Wanderers, a club side, and a team known as All Paris, comprising mostly British emigrants residing in France and possibly including a couple of French players, competed — and, unsurprisingly, Great Britain triumphed. The winning team was awarded silver medals and the loser bronze. The medals were later converted to gold and silver, respectively. \n\nAs host, the U.S. national team is guaranteed a place at the Games. But the real question is: when cricket takes the stage under the Olympic flame, who will be calling the shots — USA Cricket, or someone else nominated by the USOPC? The sporting world will be watching. \n\nResponse from ACE \n\nSportstar reached out to ACE with several questions related to the structural governance issues, including operational transparency in the USA Cricket-ACE partnership and conflict of interest. In response, ACE stated: “The questions you have raised reflect a fundamental misunderstanding of the Term Sheet and the relationship between USAC and ACE, and are both inaccurate and misleading.” \n\n“We are unable to comment further, as the Term Sheet is confidential and both parties are bound by strict confidentiality obligations,” it added. \n\n(With inputs from Santadeep Dey and Dhruva Prasad)",

    "content": "CAPF Recruitment 2025: The Central government on Wednesday informed the Rajya Sabha that there are over 1.09 lakh vacant posts in the Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) and Assam Rifles as of January 1, 2025. However, recruitment is already in progress for 72,689 of these posts.\nIn a written reply, Minister of State for Home Affairs Nityanand Rai shared details on the sanctioned and actual strength of personnel in these forces. According to the data, the sanctioned strength has increased from 10.04 lakh in 2021 to 10.67 lakh in 2025. Despite this, 1,09,868 positions remain unfilled.\nWhen asked if the government acknowledged a large number of vacancies in the six central paramilitary forces, the minister replied in the negative. He explained that vacancies arise due to routine factors such as retirement, promotions, resignations, deaths, and the creation of new battalions or posts.\nRai said the process of filling vacancies is ongoing and regular, and the ministry is actively working to speed it up. Recruitment is being conducted through agencies like UPSC, SSC, and by the forces themselves.\nALSO READ: MPESB To Hire For 752 Paramedical Posts, Registration Begins July 28\nAs part of these efforts, the government has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Staff Selection Commission for faster recruitment of constables (General Duty). CAPFs and Assam Rifles have also been asked to fill vacant non-GD posts in a time-bound manner.\nOther measures include holding promotion committee meetings on time, reducing delays in medical examinations, and lowering cut-off marks to shortlist more candidates for GD constable posts.\nNotably, the Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) are a group of seven security forces under the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India. They are primarily responsible for maintaining internal security, guarding borders, and assisting in law and order during emergencies or elections.\nThe seven CAPFs are:\n\nBorder Security Force (BSF) – Guards India’s borders with Pakistan and Bangladesh.\n\nCentral Reserve Police Force (CRPF) – Handles internal security, counter-insurgency, and crowd control.\n\nCentral Industrial Security Force (CISF) – Protects vital infrastructure like airports, nuclear plants, and government buildings.\n\nIndo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) – Guards the India-China border.\n\nSashastra Seema Bal (SSB) – Protects borders with Nepal and Bhutan.\n\nAssam Rifles – Operates in the Northeast for border security and counter-insurgency (under MHA but with administrative control from the Ministry of Defence).\n\nNational Security Guard (NSG) – A special force for counter-terrorism and hostage rescue operations.",

    "title": "What made Karnataka HC halt Russian woman Nina Kutina's deportation after she was found living in Gokarna caves",
    "content": "On Wednesday, the Karnataka High Court ordered a stay on the deportation of Nina Kutina, a Russian national who was discovered earlier this month living in a forest cave in Gokarna with her two daughters. The case was heard by Justice S Sunil Dutt Yadav, who said the decision to deport could “endanger the children and their welfare.”The court was responding to a writ petition filed against the deportation order. Kutina’s lawyer, Beena Pillai, argued that the process overlooked the children’s rights under international law.She pointed to Article 3 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which states: “The best interests of the child must be a top priority in all decisions and actions that affect children.”Taking this into account, the court said that reconsidering the deportation was “in the best interest of both the children.”No valid documents but no immediate deportationDuring the hearing, the Assistant Solicitor General, appearing for the Union of India, admitted that the children did not possess valid travel or identity documents.Live EventsThe court noted that, without proper paperwork, any move to deport the children was unreasonable at this stage.It has now asked the government to file a formal affidavit confirming the absence of documents and to submit objections within two weeks.Until then, it made one point clear: no deportation can be carried out without the court being informed. The next hearing is scheduled for 18 August.Found in a forest caveOn 9 July, police discovered Kutina and her daughters Preya, aged 6, and Ama, aged 4, living in a cave on Ramatirtha Hill in the Uttara Kannada district.Officers on patrol noticed a curtain of red saris draped over trees. Behind it, they found a small cave, a statue of a Hindu god, scattered clothes, and eventually, a child.They were stunned to find Kutina inside, asleep with her second child by her side.According to police, she had been living there for at least a week. She later admitted that she had stayed in the cave on and off for the past nine months.Her visa had expired eight years ago.Who is Nina Kutina and why is she living in the forest?Kutina told police she had moved to the cave for “spiritual solitude and to live closer to nature.”“We woke up with the sun, swam in rivers and lived in nature,” she said in interviews published by Indian media.“I cooked on a fire or gas cylinder, depending on the season, and got groceries from a nearby village. We painted, sang songs, read books and lived peacefully.”Despite warnings that the area was unsafe during the monsoon, Kutina resisted. She told police: “Animals and snakes are our friends. It is only humans who are dangerous.”Still, she was taken for a medical check-up and placed with her children in a government shelter in Tumakuru.She later messaged a friend saying they had been “placed in a prison without sky, without grass, without a waterfall, with an icy hard floor on which we now sleep for ‘protection from rain and snakes’... Once again, evil has won.”Kutina first arrived in India in 2016 and spent time at Arambol Beach in Goa. She later entered a relationship with Israeli national Dror Goldstein.She overstayed her visa and was deported in 2018. She travelled to Ukraine and gave birth to her first daughter. She already had two older sons from a previous relationship.By 2020, she was back in India. Kutina reunited with Goldstein and had another child. During this time, she made a living teaching art and languages.But Goldstein claims the relationship fell apart. He said she began disappearing with the children.In 2023, her 21-year-old son died in a motorbike crash. Goldstein, who was in Nepal renewing his visa, returned to find Kutina and the girls missing.He filed a police complaint in Goa that December. In it, he accused Kutina of “brainwashing his children and keeping them away from him.”He also said: “The Russian woman began to use me for money and often subjected me to physical and verbal abuse.”For now, Kutina remains in India, under the care of state authorities. The legal battle over her immigration status and her daughters’ custody continues.When asked why she stayed in the country without documents, she replied: “There were many complicated reasons. First, there were multiple personal losses – not just the death of my son, but also a few other close people. We were constantly dealing with grief, paperwork and other problems.”Among her belongings taken from the cave, she claimed, were her son’s ashes.

    "title": "Chicago Public Schools agrees to pay feds back $1 million over misallocated grants",
    "content": "FIRST ON FOX – The Chicago Public Schools district and the Department of Education (ED) reached an agreement to pay back over $1 million after issues arose when the district reported their Native Indian student population when applying for federal grants. Documents obtained by Fox News Digital show that the ED’s Office of Inspector General found that Chicago Public Schools were counting South Asian students from Myanmar, Pakistan and Nepal as Native Americans to receive additional federal funding. The repayment of funds is not considered a fine because the amount owed by the school district resulted from an agreement between the school district and the ED. Chicago Public Schools officials received federal funding from the Indian Education Formula Grant, which provides educational and cultural programming to students of Native American and Alaska Native Ancestry. CHICAGO SCHOOLS FACE ENROLLMENT CRISIS WITH 150 BUILDINGS HALF-EMPTY The American Indian Education Program, managed by Chicago Public Schools’ Office of Language and Cultural Education, received an annual grant from the ED's Office of Indian Education – the program's primary subsidy. In order to obtain funds, the Office of Indian Education would allocate an amount based on the total number of students enrolled in Chicago Public School’s American Indian Education Program. Students are required to be of Native American ancestry. The case first opened in 2021, when the ED Office of Inspector General (OIG) reviewed data from Chicago Public School’s student database showing over 1,000 students who identified as Native American. The investigation highlighted that several students' surnames indicated that they were of South Asian ancestry, specifically natives of India, Myanmar, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Pakistan. In 2024, the OIG investigation concluded the program manager and school district \"intentionally\" submitted and certified false information to the federal government for years. Chicago Public Schools’ reporting of the information resulted in about $140,000 more federal funds than they were entitled to during the 2022-2023 and 2023-2024 school years. The ED investigation discovered further that hundreds of thousands of undeserved federal funding was granted to the district prior to 2022. The investigation estimated a total of more than $1.1 million in misallocated funds over the past decade. The Chicago Public School District is already facing enrollment struggles, budget woes, and had tensions with the teachers' union during their contract negotiations. EDUCATION DEPARTMENT FINDS NEW YORK AGENCIES ‘VIOLATED’ CIVIL RIGHTS ACT WITH BAN ON NATIVE AMERICAN MASCOTS The school district told Fox News Digital that at no point did CPS officials misidentify students by race or ethnicity. Contrary to what the OIG report states, CPS officials claimed there was no misclassification of South Asian students as American Indian. They also said they worked closely and cooperatively with the ED's Office of Indian Education to \"review past practices and implement a stronger, more accurate system for collecting voluntary tribal enrollment information.\" \"This includes clear protocols for verifying tribal membership through federally-recognized documentation from the student, parent, or grandparent through a voluntary process at each school,\" the spokesperson added. \"The District is also enhancing training, data collection, and engagement efforts through the CPS Office of Multilingual-Multicultural Education (OMME), the Office of Family and Community Engagement (FACE), and other departments that work with Native families.\" CPS officials told Fox News Digital that ED's Office of Indian Education has commended them for \"ongoing cooperation and for proactively addressing these issues.\" CPS said they will not apply for the American Indian Education grant for Fiscal Year 2026 to proceed with caution and to ensure full compliance in the future. \"CPS has agreed to repay funds to the federal government because the District could not fully verify historical documentation related to the collection and submission of data confirming the identification of American Indian students as part of the District’s application for the American Indian Education grant,\" the spokesperson said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP However, an ED spokesperson who sent Fox News Digital the documents accused CPS of \"knowingly submitting and certifying false information about their student population.\" Reacting to the CPS statement, the ED spokesperson doubled down, referring to the OIG investigation which \"found that CPS’s American Indian Education Program, at the direction of Program Manager (redacted), has continued to submit false program enrollment on federal grant applications in 2022, 2023, and 2024, even after OIG reported in 2021 that (redacted) and the AIEP have been significantly misstating program enrollment data on grant applications for several years.\"",

    "title": "World News | Nepal Cabinet Declares Madhesh Province Disaster Crisis Zone as Absence of Rain Invites Crisis in Nation's Breadbasket",
    "content": "Kathmandu [Nepal], July 23 (ANI): An emergency cabinet meeting held on Wednesday has declared Nepal's Madhesh province a disaster crisis zone as severe drought hit the nation's breadbasket. The unusual absence of rain in the southern plains of Nepal during the mid-monsoon has pushed the region into a state of crisis. Nepali Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli on Wednesday informed the parliament that the cabinet had made a decision based on the situation in the southern plains. Also Read | Fact Check: Is Westarctica a Real Country or Fictional Name? Know the Truth As UP STF Nabs Harsh Vardhan Jain for Operating Fake Embassy in Ghaziabad.\n\"A cabinet meeting today declared the Madhesh Province a disaster crisis zone. It means the budget which are required at the time of disaster can also be used urgently,\" Oli said.\nThe decision was made based on a proposal by the Ministry of Home Affairs. The severe drought has affected all eight districts along the Terai belt of the Himalayan nation, which hosts the most fertile and arable landmass.\nAlso Read | INR vs USD: Rupee Falls for 6th Straight Session, Ends 3 Paise Lower at 86.41 Against US Dollar.\n\"The groundwater level is receding, resulting in the hand-pumps and wells running dry. There is a scarcity of drinking water; there is no water for cleaning purposes as well. Concerned with the situation there, the government, after holding discussions at various levels, has deployed different teams to resolve the situation out there,\" Oli claimed.\nThe government made the declaration under Section 32, Subsection 1, of the Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act of 2017.\nThe law allows the government to declare any area a disaster-threatening zone by publishing a notice in the Nepal Gazette, specifying its boundaries and the duration of\nThe declaration, if deemed necessary and expedient due to the occurrence of a severe disaster.\nA prolonged dry spell during the peak monsoon season has brought much of Nepal's Tarai region to the brink of an agricultural crisis.\nDue to acute water shortages, farmers are unable to transplant paddy. The drought has left seedbeds dry, and paddy saplings are withering, sparking fears of an impending food shortage in Nepal's major rice-producing region.\nAlso, the provincial government of Madhesh a few days ago declared the province a drought-hit zone. The provincial administration utilised fire trucks and tankers to distribute drinking water, but these efforts fell short of meeting the agricultural needs. The scarcity of water during mid-monsoon in the Tarai, Nepal's food basket, threatens not only farmers' livelihoods but also the national economy.\nMadhesh province, which is the breadbasket of the Himalayan Nation, still relies on rainwater for cultivation. Central bank- The Nepal Rastra Bank's 2024 report on 'Economic Status of Madhesh Province' had shown that an increase in the province's gross domestic product will be due to an increase in its agricultural production. NRB had projected Madhesh Province's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to stand at Nepali Rupees (NRs) 707 billion.\nMadhesh's GDP accounted for 13.13 per cent of the country's GDP, out of NRs 5.381 trillion. In Madhesh Province, farm products account for 35.2 per cent of the gross domestic product. Food crops, vegetables, fruits and spices are among the main products of this province. However, the dry and arid monsoon this year has increased worries for the farmers, who are now starting to worry about their coming days. Since the start of the monsoon this year, around two dozen people have already lost their lives to landslides and flooding. Several others have been injured and are missing in monsoon-related disasters. Properties and infrastructure worth billions of rupees have been either washed away by floods or buried in landslides.\nLocals in the mountainous region say that the weather has become so erratic that even light rainfall triggers floods. Scores of glacial and supraglacial lakes could burst at any time due to the melting of ice accelerated by global warming. At least eleven people were killed, and 17 others are still missing, in the Bhotekoshi flood triggered by a previously unnoticed supraglacial lake formed in Tibet above Rasuwagadhi. Nepal has been experiencing changes in temperature and precipitation at a rate faster than the global average, according to studies. Evidence indicates that the maximum temperature in Nepal is rising at a greater rate (0.05 degrees Celsius per year) than the minimum temperature (0.03 degrees Celsius per year).\nThe prevailing situation in Madhesh Province comes amid the prediction by the Met's office of above-normal monsoon rainfall this year. Nepal, on an annual basis, faces disasters such as floods, landslides, and inundation, resulting in loss of life and property.\nA continuous downpour over three days last year resulted in widespread damage to properties, as well as the loss of approximately 200 lives due to the monsoon-induced disaster. As the Himalayan Nation is bracing for above-average rainfall this year, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority (NDRRMA) has predicted that around two million (19,97,731) people from 4,57,145 households could be affected by monsoon-related disasters.\nAccording to the projection, the districts of Lumbini province will be affected the most in the monsoon--5,23,656 people from 1,19,830 households will be affected. This is\nfollowed by the Bagmati--3,27, 376 people from 74,914 households, Gandaki--2,87,107 people from 65,699 households, Koshi 2,75,867 people from 63,127 households, Madhesh--228,687 people from 52,331 households, Sudurpaschim--2,27,730 people from 52,112 households, and Karnali province--127,308 people from 29,132 households.

    "title": "ADB, AMRO slash PHL growth forecasts for 2025, 2026",
    "content": "A GLOBAL SLOWDOWN and higher US tariffs have clouded the growth outlook for the Philippines, as the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office (AMRO) both downgraded their Philippine growth projections for this year and in 2026.\n\nIn its latest Asian Development Outlook, the ADB slashed its gross domestic product (GDP) growth forecast for the Philippines to 5.6% for 2025 from 6% previously. For 2026, the ADB projects Philippine GDP to grow by 5.8% from 6.1% previously.\n\nHowever, this would be within the government’s 5.5 to 6.5% target for this year, but below the 6-7% goal for 2026.\n\nAt the same time, AMRO cut its growth projections for the Philippines to 5.6% for this year and 5.5% for 2026 in its latest ASEAN+3 Regional Economic Outlook (AREO) report. These are lower than its previous forecast of 6.3% for both 2025 and 2026.\n\nAMRO also cut the ASEAN+3 region’s growth outlook to 3.8% (from 4.2%) in 2025, and 3.6% (from 4.1%) in 2026, reflecting the impact of higher US tariffs that will take effect on Aug. 1. \n\n“These (US) tariffs will likely reduce US demand, increase investment uncertainty and dampen consumer confidence. Given the broad scope of the tariffs, the associated slowdown in global growth would further weigh on the region’s outlook,” AMRO said in the report.\n\nASEAN+3 comprises the Association of Southeast Asian Nation (ASEAN) members plus China, Hong Kong (China), Japan and South Korea.\n\nAMRO also cut the growth forecast for ASEAN to 4.4% (from 4.7%) this year, and 4.2% (from 4.7%) in 2026.\n\nBased on the latest AREO, the Philippines is expected to be the second-fastest growing economy this year and in 2026, after Vietnam. Vietnam is projected to grow by 7% this year and 6.5% next year.\n\nAMRO Group Head and Principal Economist Allen Ng said Philippine growth forecasts were lowered on expectations of slower global growth.\n\nAt a briefing on Wednesday, Mr. Ng said the Philippines’ weaker-than-expected 5.4% GDP expansion in the first quarter hinted that the “growth momentum is slower than initially expected.”\n\nMr. Ng said the country’s growth will likely remain strong, thanks to sustained private consumption, stable labor market conditions, slower inflation and “robust” remittance outlook.\n\nHe said the newly announced 19% tariff that the US will impose on Philippine goods is unlikely to change its forecasts.\n\n“In the case of the Philippines, our assessment is that the impact will be very limited and it’s unlikely that we will materially change our forecast given the changes is actually from 20% to 19%,” he said.\n\nHowever, Mr. Ng noted the impact of the higher tariffs remains smaller in the country compared with its Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) neighbors given the Philippine economy is more focused on the domestic market.\n\n“But there will be broader impact on global slowdown on the economy. So, this will affect both exports as well as business sentiment and investment activities in the Philippines,” he said.\n\nFor 2026, AMRO said the impact of the tariffs on ASEAN+3 is projected to be “more significant.” \n\n“This is particularly so for regional economies which face both higher tariffs from the US and rely more on external demand. Overall, however, continued strength in domestic demand and sustained external demand for electronics and tourism is expected to continue to underpin regional growth,” it said.\n\nMore aggressive protectionist policies from the US pose a major risk to the growth outlook for the region, AMRO said, citing potential tariffs on exempted sectors, such as semiconductors and pharmaceuticals.\n\n“As these products represent a substantial share of exports to the US for some regional economies, such measures could further dampen growth. Idiosyncratic considerations are also influencing tariff decisions, it said. \n\nOther risks include a sharper slowdown in the US and Europe, tighter financial conditions, a spike in global commodity prices and weaker growth in China.\n\nMeanwhile, AMRO lowered its inflation forecast for the Philippines to 1.8% from 3.3% for 2025. This is slightly higher than the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas’ (BSP) 1.6% average forecast for this year.\n\nAMRO kept its projection for 2026 at 3.2%, unchanged from its April forecast. This is below the central bank’s 3.4% target forecast for 2026.\n\nAMRO has noted that central banks in half of ASEAN+3 economies have eased monetary policy amid slowing inflation and tariff concerns.\n\n“Headline inflation in the region is projected to remain low and stable at around 1% in 2025 and 2026. This outlook reflects stable commodity prices, including the normalization of oil prices following the temporary volatility during the brief escalation of Iran-Israel conflict,” it said.\n\nADB FORECAST\nMeanwhile, the ADB still expects the Philippines to post the second-fastest growth in Southeast Asia this year and 2026, despite lowering its projections.\n\nVietnam is projected to grow by 6.3% this year, followed by the Philippines (5.6%), Indonesia (5%), Malaysia (4.3%), Thailand (1.8%) and Singapore (1.6%).\n\nFor 2026, Vietnam is still likely to post the fastest growth at 6%, followed by the Philippines (5.8%), Indonesia (5.1%), Malaysia (4.2%), Thailand (1.6%) and Singapore (1.5%).\n\nIn a statement, the ADB said it lowered its growth forecasts for developing Asia and the Pacific region this year and next year “driven by expectations of reduced exports amid higher US tariffs and global trade uncertainty as well as weaker domestic demand.”\n\nIt trimmed its 2025 growth forecast for the region to 4.7% from a projection of 4.9% made in April. It also cut the region’s growth outlook for 2026 to 4.6% from 4.7%.\n\n“Asia and the Pacific has weathered an increasingly challenging external environment this year. But the economic outlook has weakened amid intensifying risks and global uncertainty,” ADB Chief Economist Albert Park said in a statement.\n\nSoutheast Asia is expected to post the slowest growth among sub-regions. ADB projects Southeast Asia growth at 4.2% in 2025 and 4.3% in 2026, lower than the earlier forecasts of 4.7% for both years.\n\n“Economies in the region should continue strengthening their fundamentals and promoting open trade and regional integration to support investment, employment and growth,” Mr. Park said\n\nAccording to the ADB, developing Asia and the Pacific comprises 46 economies ranging from China to Georgia to Samoa, and excluding countries such as Japan, Australia and New Zealand.\n\nREMITTANCE DECLINE\nIn the same report, the ADB said the Philippines is expected to see the “largest proportional decline” in remittance inflows from the US once the US tax on remittances is implemented in 2026.\n\n“In the rest of the region, the Philippines is projected to face the largest proportional decline, with US remittance inflows falling by the equivalent of 0.05% of GDP, followed by Vietnam and Nepal (both 0.03%),” it said.\n\nOn the other hand, India’s potential remittance loss would be the largest in absolute terms at $315 million, but accounting for 0.01% of its GDP.\n\nMr. Trump signed the “One Big Beautiful Bill” into law on July 4, imposing a 1% excise tax on cash-based remittances from the US to recipients abroad. The tax will be implemented starting Jan. 1, 2026.\n\nThe ADB said senders finding ways to circumvent the tax will curb the impact on remittances.\n\n“However, remittance service providers may absorb part or all of the tax to remain competitive against US banks, which are exempt,” it said.\n\nThe ADB said money transfer services such as Western Union, PayPal, or MoneyGram may likely absorb part or all of the levy and negatively hit their profit margins.\n\nIt added that the US tax may also accelerate shifts toward alternative channels, including cryptocurrency transfers and informal systems, as senders seek to avoid higher fees. — Aubrey Rose A.

    "content": "The Asia Cup is supposed to be held in 2025 in the T20 format with the T20 World Cup 2026 just a few months away. However, the tournament has been in limbo ever since the dastardly Pahalgam attack where 26 innocent civilians, followed by India's subsequent retaliation in Operation Sindoor. This greatly strained the relations between India and Pakistan, which further put the tournament under risk, especially since the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) is headed by the Pakistan interior minister Mohsin Naqvi. Now, the BCCI has taken a big step that might finally put an end to the uncertainty to rest. The ACC has organized an Annual General Meeting in Dhaka, Bangladesh, set to be held on July 24 (Thursday). The BCCI had reportedly declined to attend the meeting, citing the unrest-like situation in the country. However, according to a report by ESPN Cricinfo, the apex Indian cricketing body will be attending the event virtually. Rajiv Shukla will represent the BCCI at the meeting. In this meeting, the fate of the Asia Cup is likely to be decided. FOLLOW: India Vs England 4th Test Live Score Uncertainty On Sri Lanka's Involvement In AGM Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC), like BCCI were also supposed to not attend the event. They have not yet confirmed whether thy would indeed attend the meeting either in-person on virtually. The cricket boards and of Afghanistan and Oman, after initially declining to attend the AGM, have reversed their decision. Nepal, like India have confirmed that they will attend the meeting virtually. Bangladesh Cricket Board Aminul Islam said that they are just providing logistical support to the program organized by the ACC. \"We agreed with the ACC to organise this year's AGM. It is an ACC programme. We are providing them with logistical support. That's all we are doing. We are in touch with the ACC, who is informing us who is coming and who is not, as we have to make arrangements for airport pick-ups, hotel bookings and other support,\" Aminul said.",

    "title": "How the Epstein saga exposed a system built on silence",
    "content": "In an age where every celebrity meltdown or presidential tantrum is livestreamed, where partisan jabs flood timelines within seconds, and where outrage is algorithmically amplified to viral proportions, one might assume that the most heinous crimes – especially those committed against the most vulnerable – would dominate media discourse.\n\nYet the opposite is true.\n\nGlobal child trafficking, particularly when it implicates oligarchs, elite institutions, humanitarian organizations, and religious authorities, remains one of the most underreported, diluted, and actively suppressed issues across both mainstream and alternative media ecosystems. The selective silence is not accidental as it is designed to shield power from scrutiny while feigning moral concern.\n\nTake the decades-long cover-up of Jimmy Savile’s crimes in Britain. For years, the BBC and the broader British establishment, including members of the royal family, ignored, enabled, or even protected a prolific predator in their midst. Keir Starmer, now prime minister, has faced longstanding accusations that he obstructed investigations into Savile’s network during his tenure as head of the Crown Prosecution Service. Instead of truth and accountability, Britain witnessed institutional inertia and elite protectionism.\n\nAcross the Atlantic, things are no better. US President Donald Trump – whose populist rise partly hinged on ‘draining the swamp’ and exposing elite pedophile rings – recently declared that there is “nothing to see” in the Jeffrey Epstein files. He even dismissed ongoing public concern about the case as “stupid.” This abrupt reversal betrayed many who viewed Epstein’s exposure as a gateway to unraveling deeper systemic rot.\n\nExcept for hardcore MAGA grifters and the ‘compromised cohort’, nobody bought Trump’s deflections this time around. MIT scholar and activist Dr. Shiva Ayyadurai recently issued a single, scathing tweet – linked here – sharing FBI and DOJ files which contradicted Trump’s words. These were not conspiracy breadcrumbs but official documents, offering a damning appetizer for anyone willing to dig deeper. But legacy media will ignore it, and alternative influencers will likely pivot to more ‘monetizable’ culture-war topics.\n\nCuriously, the Democratic Party – always eager to weaponize Trump’s prevarications – remained suspiciously muted on the subject. The reason is not hard to fathom. America’s political establishment functions as a duopoly. Republican or Democrat, both parties have skeletons in the same basement. When it comes to institutional crimes against children, mutual silence becomes a form of mutual protection.\n\nAt one point, the hashtag #PedoPete – referring to then-President Joe Biden – trended briefly on Twitter. Today, the trend has flipped: #PedoTrump now circulates with greater, more sustained intensity. These hashtags may sound juvenile, but they reflect the fact that both sides of the political divide are equally compromised. When elite crimes threaten to break through media filters, the duopoly instinctively closes ranks.\n\nThis is not just a media failure. It is a civilizational failure. The refusal to investigate, question, or even discuss the abuse of children by people in power suggests that, despite all our technological progress, we remain governed by the same feudal reflexes which protect the nobility, silence the peasants, and punish the whistleblowers.\n\nThat so few journalists, influencers, or institutions dare to speak plainly about this issue is not due to lack of evidence. It is due to a lack of will. The media’s silence is not benign; rather, it is complicity by omission. And increasingly, even independent platforms mirror the same herd behavior: Mainstream mimics mainstream; conspiracy mimics conspiracy. Viral outrage loops endlessly, but the hard questions go unasked.\n\nIn an attention economy driven by clicks and tribal confirmation, there’s little incentive to tackle issues that require long attention spans, moral courage, or cross-partisan inquiry. And so, the real stories – the ones involving systemic abuse, elite immunity, and generational trauma – remain locked in the basement of our public consciousness.\n\nThe question is no longer whether the truth is out there. It is whether we are still capable of seeking it.\n\nThe sordid stats\n\nAccording to the International Labor Organization, nearly 1.7 million children are victims of commercial sexual exploitation worldwide. (I believe this number to be grossly underreported). The figure does not include forced labor, child marriages, and trafficking under the guise of ‘adoption’ or ‘rescue’. These crimes often occur in the shadows, but the silence surrounding them is deafening, especially considering the alleged involvement of trusted institutions like the UN, NGOs, and faith-based charities.\n\nIn 2017, leaked internal UN reports and whistleblower testimonies revealed a disturbing pattern of sexual abuse and exploitation by peacekeepers in several African countries, notably the Central African Republic and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Victims were children – orphaned, impoverished, and completely powerless. These revelations barely made headlines beyond a few days of fleeting, dissembled horror. There was no sustained investigation, no sweeping reckoning. The UN promised reforms, but follow-up reporting was minimal. And today, those same peacekeeping structures continue to operate with minimal public scrutiny.\n\nWhat happened to the Syrian children who disappeared during the years the West, Israel, Türkiye, and Global Jihad Inc. waged war on Bashar Assad? There were disturbing allegations that US intelligence had recruited children as suicide bombers for its jihadist proxies, some of whom were also accused of harvesting the organs of over 18,000 minors.\n\nSo is it any wonder that Trump – who once vowed to defeat “radical Islamic terror” – personally lavished praise on Syria’s new president and jihadist war criminal extraordinaire Ahmed al-Sharaa?\n\nCharitable Trojan Horses\n\nThere is perhaps no greater moral shield for crimes against children than the Trojan Horse of charity. Some of the most egregious trafficking networks operate under the halo of humanitarian work. In Haiti, multiple investigations have revealed how certain orphanages and foreign-run NGOs were fronts for abuse and trafficking. In India and Nepal, similar patterns emerged: Western ‘voluntourists’ and missionaries gain access to vulnerable children under the pretext of aid, only to become conduits for exploitation. Mother Teresa’s charity organization itself was linked to child trafficking networks spanning India to Haiti.\n\nStories like these are often relegated to obscure human rights blogs or independent journalists with limited reach. Beholden to the same donor networks and oligarchic interests, the mainstream press simply looks away.\n\nThe AI crisis no one mentions\n\nWhile the AI boom dominates headlines in terms of productivity and existential risk, almost no major outlet has dared to delve into how generative AI tools are being used to create photorealistic child sexual abuse material (CSAM). The dark web is rife with communities exchanging AI-generated images, bypassing existing legal frameworks which often only address real photographic evidence.\n\nThis raises disturbing questions: What constitutes child abuse imagery in the age of AI? How will law enforcement adapt? And why is no one talking about it?\n\nThe tech platforms developing these tools are often mum about their misuse. Regulatory agencies are slow, and public debate is nearly non-existent. The media, meanwhile, prefers to debate AI replacing screenwriters rather than protecting children.\n\nIn fact, AI parodies of Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza are more likely to get censored than child sexual abuse material.\n\nImpunity and immunity\n\nThe Epstein case should have shattered any illusions about elite immunity. A convicted sex offender with connections to presidents, royalty, and top scientists managed to operate a trafficking network for years – even after his initial conviction. His mysterious ‘death in custody’ convinced no one with two functioning brain cells. His co-conspirator, Ghislaine Maxwell, was convicted. Yet not a single client has been named in court.\n\nRather than igniting systemic media scrutiny into elite involvement in trafficking, the Epstein saga has been conveniently bracketed as an anomaly or relegated to conspiracy land. But it was never just about Epstein. Similar scandals have emerged in the UK (the VIP child abuse ring), in Hollywood (Dan Schneider and Nickelodeon), and within religious institutions across continents.\n\nWhile the media has been reduced to a recycled echo chamber, the lesson bears repeating: The elite criminal class continues to get away with crimes against children with impunity. The hashtag #ArrestObama is trending before another sensationalist deflection takes over. What next? A few carefully scripted jabs at Benjamin Netanyahu to regain credibility with disillusioned MAGA voters?\n\nThe cost of silence\n\nThe decentralization of news via social media was expected to fill in vital gaps in mainstream reports. To some extent, it has. Survivors, whistleblowers, and independent researchers have found platforms to speak out. Hashtags like #SaveTheChildren briefly trended.\n\nBut these moments are fleeting. The attention span of social media is short, and the billionaire owners of these platforms are inextricably linked to various elite pedophile networks. A 2024 meta-analysis by the University of Edinburgh estimated 302 million children (1 in 8 globally) experienced online sexual abuse annually, with platforms like Facebook serving as vectors for exploitation. Earlier, in 2020, Facebook accounted for around 20 million child sexual abuse material reports, constituting nearly 95% of all incidents submitted through its systems. By comparison, Google logged 500,000, Snapchat 150,000, and Twitter just 65,000.\n\nSerious discussions are also often hijacked by fringe accounts, QAnon-style disinformation, or bad-faith actors. As a result, the issue itself becomes tainted via guilt by association. Even legitimate stories and investigations are dismissed because they were shared by someone with suspect affiliations. This is a classic tactic perfected by the likes of the CIA and Mossad.\n\nThe cost of media complicity in the face of global child trafficking is not just journalistic failure; it is moral collapse. The ongoing crimes against children is a human story of betrayal, of complicity, and of the innocent lives that are shattered while the world scrolls on.",

    "title": "‘Temporary’ in name only: How TPS allows foreigners to stay in the US for years",
    "content": "Decades-old TPS protections have been repeatedly extended between administrations, leading to foreigners treating the program as an immigration workaround and expecting extensions in perpetuity.\n\nHow ‘temporary’ is the TPS program?\n\nThe intended purpose of Temporary Protected Status, a program created through the Immigration Act of 1990, is to provide temporary humanitarian relief for foreign nationals in emergency situations who cannot safely return to their countries of origin.\n\nDuring a designated period in which their home country has such protected status, TPS holders are not deportable and are even eligible to work in the U.S.\n\nBorder hawks say that since its inception, the TPS program has been exploited as a back-door form of amnesty that shields immigrants — regardless of illegal entry — from deportation, allowing them to technically “lawfully” stay in the U.S. for years, sometimes decades, without fear of removal.\n\nTHE PERMANENT TEMPORARY PROGRAM THAT MAKES ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS LEGAL\n\n“I think one of the biggest issues with TPS is that it is in effect a lie,” Steven Camarota, director of research at the Center for Immigration Studies, told the Washington Examiner. “Take El Salvadorians who were first granted it in March 2001. That means they have had it for 24 years. This completely contradicts the ‘temporary’ intent of this program.”\n\nThe U.S. government generally grants a foreign country a TPS designation in the event of ongoing armed conflict, such as civil war, environmental disaster, epidemic, or other “extraordinary” living conditions of a temporary nature.\n\nTPS is often routinely renewed long after the triggering event. Haiti, for example, still has TPS protection despite its catastrophic 2010 earthquake, which happened nearly a decade and a half ago. Honduras and Nicaragua, the countries with the oldest TPS designations besides Somalia, have had so-called “temporary” protected status since 1999.\n\n“By no stretch of the imagination is 26 years temporary,” Federation for American Immigration Reform media director Ira Mehlman said. “In the case of Haiti, the earthquake that triggered the original designation occurred 14 years ago.”\n\nMehlman told the Washington Examiner that terminating TPS should not require ideal conditions in the home country, just that the immediate crisis no longer exists.\n\n“[Haiti] was dysfunctional and corrupt before the earthquake,” Mehlman said, “and not surprisingly, it remains so all these years later.”\n\nIn 2021, following numerous TPS extensions under the Obama administration, then-Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas announced a new TPS designation for Haiti based on “serious security concerns, social unrest, an increase in human rights abuses, crippling poverty, and lack of basic resources … exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic” as well as purported “persistent effects of the 2010 earthquake.”\n\nMehlman noted that these endless extensions and “re-designations” are pushed by the foreign nationals themselves, many of whom were illegal immigrants and had no real intention of returning home, as well as by mass immigration advocacy groups and the governments of those countries that prefer to see their citizens remain here and send home remittances.\n\n“Often, at some point in this process,” Mehlman said, “these same interest groups begin demanding that all of these ‘temporary’ guests be granted permanent status based on them having been here for so long.”\n\nHOUSE DEMOCRATS BRING BACK THE DREAM ACT\n\nTwo Biden administration-era bills that would have provided Lawful Permanent Resident status to certain TPS recipients passed in the House but stopped short in the Senate. Title II of the American Dream and Promise Act of 2021 would have allowed TPS-eligible aliens who had been in the U.S. for three years to become LPRs, and the Farm Workforce Modernization Act of 2021 would have established a legal framework for farm workers granted TPS to obtain LPR status eventually.\n\nHouse Democrats introduced similar measures during the last legislative session, such as the 2023 version of the American Dream and Promise Act, which had a provision that would have provided TPS holders with a path to permanent residency.\n\nAn overwhelming TPS approval rate, relatively few denials\n\nTPS is meant to be a “blanket” suspension mechanism against the threat of deportation, ensuring automatic relief from removal.\n\nSo far in fiscal 2025, only 7,599 applications for temporary protected status have been denied out of 518,848 total requests, constituting a 1.5% denial rate, according to data from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.\n\nMeanwhile, 290,167 applicants were approved, a majority from Venezuela (115,380) and Haiti (107,659). As of March 31, 808,124 cases were “pending” and awaiting an adjudicative decision.\n\nHowever, some submissions, including those ultimately approved or denied, were received prior to this reporting period, which started on Oct. 1. USCIS does not specify which filings predate this disclosure cycle. Processing of a TPS application typically takes around six months.\n\nAccording to a Washington Examiner analysis of annual TPS statistics, approval and denial breakdowns have been similarly disparate since at least fiscal 2013, the last year USCIS provides publicly available data documenting differences in case outcomes.\n\nTPS approvals overwhelmingly outpace denials, the datasets show:\n\nIt is unclear exactly how many were returning TPS holders. The number of renewals is not reported annually, although applicants must indicate on Form I-821, the application for temporary protected status, whether they are first-time TPS seekers or re-registering.\n\nUSCIS was contacted for comment on the disclosure data.\n\nThe state of TPS today\n\nThrough recurring extensions and “re-designations,” TPS has incentivized illegal immigrants to flood the U.S. border.\n\nIn fiscal 2023, the volume of TPS applications increased by about 137% due to new and extended designations for 16 foreign nations. On their applications, 57.2% of TPS seekers claim that their prior immigration status is “Unknown,” meaning they may have illegally entered the U.S. without inspection, were stowaways, or had overstayed their visas, USCIS reported to Congress at the time.\n\nAs of Sept. 30, approximately 1,095,115 foreign nationals from TPS-designated countries were residing in the U.S. with TPS protection, according to a congressional research report based on USCIS estimates.\n\nLebanon’s TPS designation came after the Sept. 30 data collection ↩︎\n\nTPS recipients are settled all across the U.S. The largest populations of TPS holders live in Florida (357,895) and Texas (124,710), followed by New York (86,665), California (72,585), and Georgia (41,325), according to USCIS settlement counts.\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s first administration tried to terminate TPS for several foreign states, such as Haiti and El Salvador, after determining that the circumstances in these countries no longer warranted TPS protections.\n\nLawfare ensued, forcing Trump’s Department of Homeland Security to continue TPS pending litigation. Former President Joe Biden rescinded the terminations by extending TPS eligibility and issuing newly defined designations, rendering the legal matters moot.\n\nTRUMP ADMINISTRATION ABANDONS BIDEN-ERA TPS EXTENSIONS FOR HAITIAN MIGRANTS\n\n“So what was designed to be a temporary program done at the discretion of the executive becomes a permanent program that cannot be ended even if the president wishes to do so,” Camarota said.\n\nGiven that few groups have ever lost this protected status, coverage under the TPS program has, in effect, become “indefinitely temporary,” Camarota explained.\n\nConsequently, this not-so-temporary aspect incites a sense of widespread public cynicism, according to Camarota. “So, it is not just that the program has been abused by administration after administration, it is that the program destroys public confidence in our immigration system.”\n\n“Reforming the TPS program would require that our government acknowledge that the ‘T’ stands for ‘temporary,'” Mehlman said.\n\nAmong much-needed fundamental reforms, Mehlman suggested limiting the duration that TPS recipients are allowed to remain in the immediate aftermath of the qualifying crisis.\n\n“If the temporary nature of TPS cannot be honored, then the program should be scrapped,” Mehlman said.\n\nTRUMP’S EFFORTS TO END TPS FOR MULTIPLE COUNTRIES TIED UP IN LEGAL BATTLES\n\nNow in his second term, Trump’s administration is attempting again to end TPS coverage for a handful of foreign countries, including Venezuela, Nepal, Cameroon, Afghanistan, Nicaragua, Honduras, and Haiti, by way of revocation or allowing designations to lapse in the absence of renewal.\n\nLike last time, these efforts face challenges in court, although the Trump administration is racking up wins with the Supreme Court and at the appellate level.",

    "title": "U.S. probes foreign links to agriculture research to protect food supply",
    "content": "The Agriculture Department is applying more scrutiny to research done by its employees alongside noncitizens.\n\nThe directives, laid out in a memo which went out to USDA employees and research institutions earlier this month, are part of a broader effort to increase security measures around the U.S. food supply — especially when it comes to foreign adversaries like North Korea, China, Russia and Iran.\n\nThe sweeping instructions require recipients of USDA funding to disclose contracts associated with \"foreign entities and certify they are not party to a malign foreign talent recruitment program.\"\n\nAs a result of the policy, USDA also laid off 70 researchers earlier this month who were from \"countries of concern\" — which included Syria, South Africa, Cuba and Venezuela.\n\n\"It is absurd that foreign nationals from countries of concern were so close to our critical research at USDA,\" a USDA spokesperson said in a statement to NPR. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins \"is committed to securing our agricultural research enterprise from foreign adversaries and putting American farmers and ranchers first.\"\n\nThe policy is a part of the \"National Farm Security Action Plan\" unveiled by the department alongside other members of the administration's cabinet to boost domestic manufacturing, research and production.\n\nInternal and outside researchers agree food security is important. But they say added scrutiny on collaborative agriculture research could hurt U.S. innovation. The directives this month also come on the heels of cuts to research generally to colleges and universities — many of which partner with the USDA on their work.\n\nThe new policy directs USDA employees to stop collaborating and communicating with people who might be from the list of countries of concern.\n\nThe directive also prohibits all USDA employees and affiliates from recruiting foreign workers, and requires prior approval before accepting outside employment or coauthoring scholarly publications with a foreign national.\n\n\"The broader impacts will be devastating. There was quite a bit of collaboration between the [Agricultural Research Service] and Chinese scientists,\" said Ethan Roberts, president of a local chapter of the union that in part represents employees at the National Center for Agricultural Utilization Research.\n\nForeign research collaborations\n\nIn the U.S., about 14% of those with bachelor's degrees, 26% with master's and 42% with doctoral degrees working in biological, agricultural and other life sciences were foreign-born in 2021, according to the latest data from the National Science Foundation. Most were naturalized citizens; others were lawful permanent residents or temporary visa holders.\n\nThe Health and Human Services Department and Department of Defense provide the largest share of U.S. research funding. But the impact of USDA cuts could also be significant: the agency funded some $3 billion in research in fiscal year 2022; the USDA is the primary funder of U.S. agricultural research and development, according to the department.\n\nWhile the National Institutes of Health, which is within HHS, has not put this kind of scrutiny on foreign-born researchers, it has prohibited certain grant dollars from going to \"foreign entities.\"\n\nThe researchers laid off at USDA were noncitizens working as contractors, mostly as post-doctoral researchers and students, according to the American Federation of Government Employees union which represents workers in the Agricultural Research Service arm of the USDA. The majority were Chinese nationals.\n\nLate last week, Chinese nationals with green cards were informed they would be reinstated following a reinvestigation — but no timeline was provided, according to the union.\n\n\"It's the silencing and the prevention of science being released to the world,\" Roberts said. \"We deal with food safety and food productivity. If those discoveries are not being shared, then there's not going to be progress on making our food safer and making our crops more productive.\"\n\nFor example, one recent research collaboration between the USDA and Chinese scientists looked into how diseases can affect crop yields and plants.\n\nNew policies go further than past regulations\n\nThe USDA previously reviewed research from noncitizens, but it was rare, Roberts said. There were some limitations on countries, mainly Iran, he said — but the new policy applies to all foreign nationals, meaning any foreign collaborations already in process must be interrupted.\n\nOthers in the research community who work with USDA are also feeling the ripple effects from the new rules.\n\nColleges and universities across the U.S., especially land grant universities, conduct research related to water conservation, automation, pesticide and herbicide use and food safety in partnership with USDA. Experts told NPR many of these topics are workshopped alongside foreign researchers.\n\nChristina Hagerty, an associate professor at Oregon State University, conducts research alongside USDA. Her research focuses on the wheat growers in the Pacific Northwest.\n\nThe postdoctoral scholar in her lab is a foreign national from Nepal. Because her lab shares a space with USDA, she has been told by federal colleagues that scholar now can't enter the lab or work by himself without constant supervision by ARS staff.\n\n\"In eastern Oregon, wheat isn't just a crop. It's the backbone of the rural economy,\" Hagerty said. Her lab's research wants to help family wheat farmers become more profitable in the face of various challenges such as drought, soil health issues, and the use of fungicides.\n\nShe said the new rules impede her research and limits resources, and could also hinder a rising class of scientists.\n\n\"Not only will our publication flow be reduced, but it's going to have significant impacts on the careers of this next generation of scientists,\" she said.\n\n\"We're working on global issues,\" Hagerty said. \"We need the best and the brightest, regardless of their country of origin, to help us solve these problems.\"\n\nNPR's Saige Miller contributed to this story.",

    "content": "Maulana Jamaluddin Shah alias Maulana Changur has emerged as the prime suspect in a sprawling religious conversion and land jihad racket being investigated by the Uttar Pradesh ATS and Enforcement Directorate (ED). According to authorities, Changur allegedly received foreign funding over the past several years, which was used to orchestrate mass conversions and purchase land under suspicious circumstances. The investigation revealed that Changur turned regions like Balrampur, Utraula, and Gonda into hubs for illegal religious conversions. He allegedly manipulated vulnerable populations—particularly the poor and uneducated—by offering incentives and spreading radical ideology. In parallel, he and his close network reportedly acquired prime land at throwaway prices, often using benami transactions, and later sold or developed it illegally. The UP government has ordered an inquiry into 351 registry offices, looking into Changur and 13 of his associates for illegal land registrations. Authorities have also discovered possible Nepal links, with operatives allegedly active in border districts to expand the conversion network. The crackdown has intensified, with bulldozer action likely on illegal properties linked to Changur's relatives. Officials are determined to expose the full extent of this network and bring those responsible to justice.",

    "title": "Polyandry part of ancient tribal tradition, says Himachal Ministers after woman marries two men",
    "content": "Polyandry is not new to Himachal Pradesh and a primary reason for its prevalence in some parts of the state is keeping a family intact and the landholdings undivided, say multiple people familiar with this tradition.\n\nThis anachronistic tradition came to limelight after two brothers of the Hatti tribe in Shillai village of the Transgiri area of Sirmaur district tied the knot to the same woman earlier this month. \n\n“It is not a new tradition. Polyandry is a part of ancient tribal tradition and culture to keep the land undivided and is prevalent in parts of Kinnaur and Sirmaur districts,” said Revenue, Horticulture and Tribal Minister Jagat Singh Negi, who is the MLA from the Kinnaur constituency.\n\nSunita Chauhan married Pradeep and Kapil Negi, saying they are proud of this tradition and have taken the decision jointly.\n\n“The tradition is old and there would be a rare house in Shallai where such a marriage has not taken place,” said Industry Minister Harshwardhan, who represents the Shallai constituency.\n\nRevenue laws of Himachal Pradesh recognise this tradition, which is named “Jodidara”. The tradition is also recognised under sections 494 and 495 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).\n\nHimachal Pradesh’s first Chief Minister, Y.S. Parmar, did research on this tradition and his Ph.D. from Lucknow University was on “Polyandry in Himalayas “Socio-economic background of Himalayan Polyandry”.\n\n“According to the research of Y.S. Parmar, polyandry was prevalent in all five khand (sections) of the Himalayas from Kashmir to Nepal and there were psychological, biological and economic reasons behind the practice,” former chairman of Dr. Y.S. Parmar Chair at Himachal Pradesh University O.P. Sharma told PTI.\n\nSome segments of warrior communities, especially Khasu and Tod, believe that teh Pandavas of Mahabharata are their ancestors and willingly continue the tradition, he said, adding Parmar had also quoted statistics of screwed sex ratio which showed that the number of girls were less than boys.\n\n“Keeping small landholdings intact and less expense on weddings were the economics behind the tradition,” he said.\n\nHe asserted that Parmar “did not encourage the practice of polyandry in view of women exploitation and I share the same views”.\n\n“If live-in relations are accepted, then why is there an issue with age-old traditions? There are 15-20 families in my village Koti (Sirmaur district) where a woman is married to more than one man and we want the tradition to continue,” says law student Krishan Pratap Singh.\n\nRelations stay healthy in the family and land stays intact in joint marriage, says Balma Devi.\n\nPolyandry is an old tradition in which brotherhood remains and expenses are handled adequately, says Sant Ram.\n\n“We four brothers are married to two women,” he adds.\n\nHatti is a closed-knit community in the Himachal Pradesh-Uttarakhand border and was declared as Scheduled Tribe three years ago. In this tribe, polyandry was in vogue for centuries, but due to rising literacy among women and economic uplift of communities in the region, cases of polyandry were not reported much as it used to be a simple ceremony.\n\n“We have got tribal status due to such old traditional practices which also find mention in revenue records. Polyandry is prevalent in about 150 villages in the Trans Giri area of Sirmaur district and is still a practising tradition in some villages. It was also prevalent in Jaunsar Babar, tribal area of Uttarakhand,” said spokesperson of Hatti Vikas Manch, Ramesh Singta.\n\nSuch marriages are being solemnised in a clandestine manner and accepted by the society but instances are fewer, elders in the village said.\n\nKundan Singh Shastri, general secretary of the prime body of the Hatti community Kendriya Hatti Samiti, said this tradition was invented thousands of years ago to save a family's agricultural land from further division.\n\nAnother reason is to promote brotherhood and mutual understanding in a joint family by marrying even two or more brothers born from different mothers with a single bride, he told PTI. The third reason is a feeling of security.\n\n“If you have a big family with more men, you are more secure in a tribal society,” he said, adding it also helps in managing scattered agriculture lands in far-flung, hard, hilly areas which requires a family for a long time for care and cultivation.\n\nThese requirements of tribal families have kept the polyandry system in practice for thousands of years; though these traditions are slowly dying, Mr. Shastri added.",

    "content": "ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s trade deficit with nine neighbouring countries expanded by 29.42 per cent in FY25, rising to $12.297 billion compared to $9.502bn in the preceding year.\n\nExports registered notable growth to Bangladesh, Afghanistan, and Sri Lanka, largely attributed to recent shifts in the regional political landscape. However, trade relations with these countries have remained strained in recent years, primarily due to challenges stemming from restrictive government policies.\n\nDespite the uptick in exports, the overall trade gap with regional partners widened, driven predominantly by increased imports from China, India, and Bangladesh during the months under review.\n\nIn FY24, the trade deficit with these countries was $9.506bn, up 49pc from $6.382bn in the preceding year.\n\nPakistan’s exports to Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka saw a hefty growth in July-June FY25. Still, exports to other countries, especially China, continued to decline during the period, according to data compiled by the State Bank of Pakistan.\n\nThe value of Pakistan’s exports to nine countries — Afghanistan, China, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, India, Iran, Nepal, Bhutan and the Maldives — rose 1.49pc to $4.401bn in July-June FY25 from $4.336bn over the same period last year.\n\nContrary to this, imports surged 20.66pc to $16.698bn in FY25 from $13.838bn over the same period of the previous fiscal year.\n\nFurther analysis showed that imports from China grew by 20.79pc to $16.312bn in FY25 from $13.504bn over the same period last year. In FY24, imports from China totalled $13.506bn, up by 39.78pc from $9.662bn over the previous year. The bulk of imports in the region are sourced from China, with partial contributions from India and Bangladesh.\n\nPakistan’s exports to China dipped 8.6pc to $2.476bn in FY25 from $2.709bn over the same months in the preceding fiscal year.\n\nImports from India increased pc to $220.58m in FY25 from $206.89m over the last year. In FY24, imports from India rose 6.62pc to $206.89m — up from $190.04m in the same period last year. Meanwhile, exports to India remained at $1.43m in FY25. Exports to India totalled $3.669m in FY24 against $0.329m in the same period the previous year.\n\nExports to Afghanistan increased 38.68pc to $773.89m in FY25 from $558.03m last year. Imports stood at $25.89m against $11.96 in FY24, a growth of 116.47pc. Pakistan’s main exports to Afghanistan include sugar in the current fiscal year. In the past four months, Pakistan has exported more than 700,000 tonnes of sugar, mostly to Afghanistan.\n\nNo data is available as most trade with Iran is conducted via informal channels. However, Pakistan has opted for barter trade amid the thriving smuggling of Iranian petroleum products and LPG via a porous border of Balochistan.\n\nExports to Bangladesh increased by 19.08pc to $787.35m in FY25 from $661.19m. Imports grew 38.47pc to $78.31m in FY from $56.55m over the last year. The increase resulted after the toppling of the Hasina government in Dhaka. Pakistan has started exporting rice to Bangladesh in the current fiscal year.\n\nExports to Sri Lanka dropped 4.14pc to $376.61m in FY25 from $392.89m over the last year. This decline in exports to Sri Lanka occurred following the recession in economic activity.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 23rd, 2025",

They also questioned the figures of likely deletion from the rolls.\n “Did the summary revision fail to note this and revise the rolls accordingly?” they asked.\n The party pointed out that though there is a provision for migrants to fill the form online, which was “belatedly” pulicised in newspapers, many may not have access to information and internet facilities.\n They also said it is “well known” that large numbers of electors do not have the documents mentioned in the EC’s indicative list of eleven documents.\n “On the basis of our experience of the first four weeks of the SIR drive in Bihar, we are afraid that mass disenfranchisement remains a very real danger for Bihar’s poor, women, migrant workers and young electors, with all its alarming consequences,” the CPI(ML) said.\n “We therefore once again urge the EC to withdraw the SIR circular and conduct the forthcoming Assembly elections of Bihar on the basis of a duly updated version of the electoral rolls used for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections,” they said.\n The EC, in its statement, said the meeting is in continuation of the interactions being held by ECI with the presidents of various national and state political parties.\n “These interactions provide for a long-felt need of constructive discussions which enable national and state party presidents to share their suggestions and concerns directly with the commission,” it said.\n “This initiative aligns with the commission’s broader vision of further strengthening the electoral process in accordance with the existing legal framework with all stakeholders,” it said.\n The EC added that in March, a total of 4,719 all-party meetings were conducted, including 40 meetings by CEOs, 800 by DEOs, and 3879 by EROs, engaging over 28,000 representatives of various political parties.

    "content": "Crypto billionaire Justin Sun, known best for his controversial blockchain platform Tron and his connection to President Donald Trump, will be the next super-wealthy tourist to go to space after paying $28 million for a seat with Blue Origin.\n\nJustin Sun.\nGareth Brown for Forbes\n\nSun, 34, on Monday announced he would be one of six crew members on Blue Origin’s NS-34 mission alongside several other businessmen, a meteorologist and a British philanthropist.\n\nThe announcement comes four years after Sun paid $28 million for a seat on Blue Origin's first-ever crewed spaceflight alongside founder Jeff Bezos, but had to back out due to scheduling conflicts, the company said at the time.\n\nSun, who was born in China but now a citizen of Saint Kitts and Nevis, is facing civil charges in the United States for fraud and market manipulation, but his SEC lawsuit was paused earlier this year when the Trump administration dropped virtually all of its lawsuits and investigations against alleged crypto violators.\n\nGt Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We’re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day’s headlines.

No date has been set for Blue Origin’s NS-34 mission, the 14th human flight for the New Shepard program, but the company said a date will be announced \"soon.\"\n\nCrucial Quote\n\n“Proud to join Blue Origin’s NS-34 mission and continue encouraging youth to pursue their dreams in science and space!” Sun said Monday.\n\nWho Will Be On Blue Origin’s Next Spaceflight?\n\nIn addition to Sun, Blue Origin will take five other tourists to space with the NS-34 mission: real estate investor Arbi Bahal, Turkish businessman Gökhan Erdem, venture capitalist James Russell, Puerto Rican meteorologist and journalist Deborah Martorell and Lionel Pitchford, founder of a nonprofit and orphanage in Nepal.\n\nKey Background\n\nSun, known for his publicity stunts, is one of the most polarizing personalities in the crypto industry. He has a sprawling crypto empire, anchored by the Tron blockchain he founded in 2017. He later acquired the crypto exchange Poloniex and peer-to-peer file-sharer BitTorrent, and is also associated with crypto exchange HTX. In March 2023, Sun was charged with fraud for allegedly manipulating the market for Tron's TRX token by wash trading, the process of buying and selling tokens simultaneously to amp up the impression of active trading. He was also accused of offering and selling TRX and BitTorrent (BTT) tokens as unregistered securities, and of paying celebrities to promote tokens on social media without disclosing they were paid endorsements. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime has called Tron a \"preferred choice for crypto money launderers\" in Asia, and it has allegedly been used in Chinese Ponzi schemes. Former employees sued Sun for alleged labor violations and harassment in 2020. The suit later went to arbitration.\n\nSun’s ties to Trump have deepened since he financed the $30 million needed to launch the Trump family’s crypto venture, World Liberty Financial weeks after Trump's re-election, which ignited a buying frenzy. Sun later invested another $45 million, 75% of which went directly into Trump’s pocket, according to a disclosed stipulation. Sun then invested in the president's meme coin, $TRUMP, and generated an estimated $400 million for the Trumps while netting himself very little. Months later, the Trump administration paused the SEC investigation against him.. In April, Trump launched a stablecoin, called USD1, pegged to the U.S. dollar and in June, Sun announced his blockchain Tron had started minting USD1, which directly benefits World Liberty Financial based on the interest earned by the stablecoin’s reserves. In July, he said he was buying another $100 million worth of $TRUMP. Sun told Forbes he's been an admirer of Trump since he was in middle school and learned vernacular English watching \"The Apprentice.\"\n\nSurprising Fact\n\nSun is best known for spending $6.2 million on a modern artwork featuring a banana duct-taped to a wall. Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan created the conceptual work and it sold to Sun at a Sotheby’s auction in New York in November. He later ate the fruit.\n\nForbes Valuation\n\nSun is worth an estimated $8.5 billion and was the 383th richest person in the world as of Tuesday.\n\nFurther Reading\nForbesMeet The Crypto Billionaire Who Helped The Trumps Make $400 MillionBy Nina BambyshevaForbesPresident Trump’s Crypto Firm Expands Relationship With Embattled Blockchain BillionaireBy Zach EversonForbesJustin Sun Is Bullish On Dubai And Stablecoins.

    "content": "Kathmandu, Jul 22 (PTI) Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli on Tuesday called for faster implementation of projects under China's Belt and Road Initiative to help transform Nepal from a landlocked to a land-connected country during his meeting with a senior Chinese government official here. China International Development Cooperation Agency (CIDCA) Chairman Chen Xiaodong called on PM Oli at his official residence in Baluwatar, the Prime Minister's secretariat said.

Chen, who is leading a delegation to Nepal, held discussions with Oli on strengthening bilateral ties and expediting the implementation of infrastructure and development agreements signed during previous high-level exchanges between Nepal and China, it said. During the meeting, Oli reiterated Nepal's firm commitment to the One-China policy and expressed gratitude for Beijing's assistance in developing key infrastructure at the Rasuwagadhi border point, which was recently damaged by flash floods.

He also stressed the importance of ensuring unhindered operation of other border crossings, including Kimathanka, and called for faster implementation of projects under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) to help transform Nepal from a landlocked to a land-connected country, the PM's secretariat said. The BRI, also referred to as the New Silk Road, is initiated by China for building land and sea infrastructure in multiple countries, including Nepal, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. CIDCA is China's key foreign aid agency responsible for planning and coordinating Beijing's global development initiatives, including projects under the BRI framework. The BRI has raised global concerns over China's debt diplomacy of extending huge loans to smaller countries for unsustainable infrastructure projects. India has been severely critical of the BRI, as the project includes China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) that passes through Pakistan-Occupied-Kashmir.

    "content": "Kathmandu, Jul 22 (PTI) Senior leaders of ruling Nepali Congress(NC) have decided to ask the K P Sharma Oli-led coalition government to expedite the process of constitution amendment to strengthen the democratic republic system.\nThe decision was taken on Monday in a meeting of seven former office bearers of the NC at the residence of NC leader and Deputy Prime Minister and Urban Development Minister Prakash Man Singh in Chaksibari.\nSenior Nepali Congress leader Bimalendra Nidhi, who was also present at the meeting, said that the need to move forward with the agreement on constitution amendment, reached between the ruling Congress and the CPN (UML), was discussed.\n“Constitution amendment is necessary for effective implementation of federal, democratic republic system and to address the issues related to the rights and proper representation of women, backward communities and marginalised people,” Nidhi told PTI.\nThey raised concern regarding the lack of initiative on the part of the coalition government to take steps needed for constitution amendment to strengthen the democratic republic system, he said.\nSimilarly, the meeting discussed the need for the government to work more effectively in the best interests of the people, in line with the spirit of the ruling alliance.\nThe leaders also discussed the latest political situation in the country, government’s performance, party’s internal politics and ways to enhance the party’s image among the general public, Nidhi added.\nSenior NC leaders Krishna Sitaula, Gopalman Shrestha, Bijay Kumar Gachhadar, Shashank Koirala and Prakash Sharan Mahat were also present at the meeting.\nAs ten years have already passed since the promulgation of the new constitution, it has become essential to make necessary amendments to the constitution, keeping in view the weaknesses and shortcomings seen while implementing the statute,Nidhi pointed out.

    "title": "Opinion | Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh: A Legacy Of 70 Years, A Future Of Hope",
    "content": "Dattopant Thengadiji, the founder of Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS), often remarked that BMS was a “Sangh Srushti” – a creation of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). He founded the organisation under the able guidance of Guruji Golwalkar, the second Sarsanghchalak of the RSS.\nBharatiya Mazdoor Sangh was the last of the major central trade union organisations to be formed, after AITUC, INTUC, HMS, and others. Yet, within just 34 years, it rose to become the largest Central Trade Union in the country. Throughout its journey, the BMS championed issues often ignored by other unions.\nIndia has a rich tradition of a powerful trade union movement. Much of the progress and rights enjoyed by workers today are the result of tireless struggles led by towering figures like Mahatma Gandhi, Dr BR Ambedkar, and Dattopant Thengadiji, who were also eminent leaders of the trade union movement.\nBeyond bread and butter, national spirit at the core\nThe BMS has been at the forefront in ensuring decent wages and working conditions for the workers. But it always thought beyond bread and butter. It has been distinguished by its deeply nationalist character. Its rallying call in the labour sector was ‘Nationalise the Labour’. It firmly rejected both “political unionism” and mere “bread and butter trade unionism”. In negotiations, the BMS advocated not just for the workers but considered society at large as a third and most critical stakeholder in all industrial matters, apart from workers and employers. While striving for better wages and improved working conditions, the BMS consistently emphasised that workers’ efforts must contribute meaningfully to nation-building. This balancing vision was captured in its inspiring slogan: ‘Desh ke hit mein karenge kaam, kaam ke lenge poore daam’ (‘We shall work in the nation’s interest, and receive full wages for our work’).\nIn times of national crisis, the BMS consistently called upon Indian labour to rise in service of the nation. During the Chinese aggression in 1962, the Indo-Pak wars of 1965 and 1971, and the liberation of Bangladesh, the BMS mobilised like-minded trade unions to form the Rashtriya Mazdoor Morcha to support the government’s war efforts. It also suspended all protests and demands during these periods.\nTrue to its cultural roots, the BMS has promoted a trade union movement grounded in the Bharatiya ethos. It celebrates Vishwakarma Jayanti on September 17 as National Labour Day—an alternative to May Day. May Day is observed in remembrance of a failed struggle that ultimately weakened the trade union movement in the United States, where the events associated with May Day originally took place. In India, Vishwakarma symbolises the dignity and noble status of labour in society. Today, several states officially observe a holiday on this day.\nLandmark contributions in the service of labour\nThe BMS has been at the forefront of many groundbreaking labour reforms. Wages constitute the most critical element in fulfilling the economic aspirations of the labour. The BMS was the first to critically study and expose flaws in the calculation of the Consumer Price Index (CPI), the basis for determining Dearness Allowance. Despite initial opposition from other unions like INTUC and HMS, who later came to endorse it, the movement gained momentum, culminating in a successful Mumbai Bandh on 20th August 1963. The government eventually appointed the Lakdawala Committee to revise CPI methodology.\nThe BMS championed the principle that the bonus is a deferred wage, advocating the slogan “Bonus for All” – a position later adopted by all major stakeholders in the labour sector. The First National Commission on Labour, chaired by Justice Gajendragadkar, was established in 1967. The BMS made an exhaustive submission before the Commission outlining a comprehensive set of demands for the welfare of labour.\nIn 1971, the BMS took up the issue of domestic workers, recognising that they lacked both legal protection and formal recognition within the labour framework. The BMS established the Gharelu Kamgar Sangh in Mumbai. A massive rally of around 60,000 domestic workers took place during BMS’s third national conference on 22-23 May 1972.\nIn 1974, the Bharatiya Railway Mazdoor Sangh played a pivotal role in the national railway strike along with other unions. While some other unions contemplated damaging national property during the strike, the BMS firmly insisted that the strike be carried out without harming any national assets. The struggle continued without causing any loss of national property.\nA voice of resistance in times of oppression\nOn July 26, 1976, Indira Gandhi imposed the Emergency. In response, the Lok Sangarsh Samiti was formed, and a joint circular was issued by BMS, CITU, HMS, and HMKP. While leaders of other central trade unions were later afraid and reluctant to continue the agitation against the autocratic rule, the BMS took to the streets, resulting in the arrest of more than 5,000 of its activists, with around 111 imprisoned under the oppressive MISA law. The courageous resistance and the sacrifices made by the BMS during the Emergency won the confidence of workers across the country. It led to a period of growth for the organisation after the Emergency was lifted in 1977. Representing the BMS for the first time, Thengadiji attended the 63rd session of the International Labour Conference of the ILO in Geneva, Switzerland, in 1977 as part of the Indian delegation. By 1980, the BMS was declared the second-largest Central Trade Union in the country by the Congress Government, next to INTUC. Following this, the BMS was officially included in every Indian trade union delegation to international conferences and forums such as the ILO. Finally, based on the 1989 verification conducted by the then Congress government, the BMS was declared the largest central trade union in the country by the same Government. Consequently, in the 1990s, the BMS was entrusted with the responsibility of leading Indian delegations to the ILO and other international forums.\nBy 1980, the Government officially recognised the BMS as the second-largest central trade union, after INTUC. Following the 1989 verification conducted by the Congress government, the BMS was declared the largest central trade union in the country. From the 1990s onwards, the BMS began leading Indian delegations to global labour fora, including the ILO.\nIn 1980, leaders from various trade unions were invited to participate in the Viswakarma Jayanti celebrations, which BMS observed as Labour Day. On June 4, 1981, a National Campaign Committee comprising eight Central Trade Unions and National Industrial Federations, including the BMS, was formed to counter the government’s flawed anti-labour policies. In 1986, 10 central trade unions once again united to form a common platform to address broader issues such as national unity, disarmament, and racial discrimination. The BMS welcomed this initiative and played a leading role in these activities with the vision of advancing world peace and harmony.\nDuring its seventh national conference in 1984, held in Hyderabad, BMS declared a ‘War of Economic Independence Against Imperialism.’\nTechnology, yes, but not at the cost of jobs\nThe BMS firmly believes that technology and machines should assist, not replace, human workers. Given India’s status as a labour-surplus country, the BMS asserts that technologies should be ‘adapted’ to suit Indian conditions rather than ‘adopted’ in their original form, as uncritical adoption may adversely impact employment. In line with this, the 1981 Hyderabad conference resolved to observe 1984 as ‘Anti-Computerisation Year’ in protest against labour-displacing devices. However, the BMS did not object to the use of computers in complex domains such as research, defence, meteorology, oceanography and the like.\nIt also demanded a Round Table Conference involving all stakeholders to deliberate on the job-displacing impacts of computerisation, particularly in sectors like banking. Four decades later, the world is once again engaged in the same debate, raising similar concerns and arguments in response to the growing spread of artificial intelligence and robotics.\nThe BMS has adopted a distinctive policy of “responsive co-operation” toward successive governments, regardless of political affiliation.\nReplacing class conflict with harmony\nOn the international front, the BMS replaced the class-divisive Communist slogan ‘Workers of the World, Unite!’ with its message of harmony: ‘Workers, Unite the World!’ The BMS has maintained positive relationships with global trade union movements. Notably, the BMS was invited as a special guest to the pro-Communist Conference of the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) in Moscow in November 1991. At this conference, Prabhakar Ghate presented before the World, the BMS’s apolitical ideals for a genuine trade union movement.\nWhen the ILO proposed incorporating a social clause in trade agreements with developing countries, the BMS strongly opposed the move. The social clause, which aimed to prohibit imports from countries allegedly using child labour, would have jeopardised export prospects for nations like India and Nepal. The then BMS representative, R Venugopal, mobilised many developing nations against it.\nTo empower women workers, the BMS established its women’s wing during the 1981 conference in Kolkata. In April 1994, the Sarvapanth Samadar Manch was founded to foster religious harmony in India’s diverse cultural landscape. In 1995, the ‘Paryavaran Manch’ was launched to address rising environmental concerns, such as the rising levels of industrial pollution and their adverse effects. The initiative championed the Bharatiya ethos that ‘Mother Nature should be milked, not exploited’.\nTo safeguard the nation’s economic interests in global forums, the BMS organised a massive rally on April 16, 2001 at Ram Lila Grounds in New Delhi, attended by lakhs of workers. The rally highlighted the potential dangers of blindly following WTO policies, with the slogan: ‘WTO Modo, Todo, Ya Chodo (Change WTO, Break It, or Quit It)’.\nThe BMS regards labour as the true capital and promotes the concept of ‘Labourisation of Industry’. This approach was successfully piloted in Calcutta Jute Mills and other industries for a considerable period. Labourisation encompasses three components: a share in capital investment, participation in management, and proportional profit sharing. The BMS asserted that labour participation should go beyond tokenism on boards of directors; workers should be prioritised in the allotment of company shares and in the distribution of profits.\nThe Vajpeyi Government constituted the Second National Commission on Labour under the chairmanship of Ravindra Verma. While leftist trade unions boycotted the commission, the BMS submitted a comprehensive memorandum addressing labour’s varied needs in June 2001. When the commission made anti-worker recommendations on eight key issues, Saji Narayanan CK, a member of the Commission and representative of the BMS, submitted a dissenting note that drew widespread attention in labour circles. One media outlet wrote, the dissenting note of BMS would be remembered more than the Commission’s report itself.\nA leader in modern labour movements\nOn November 23, 2011, the BMS held a historic rally in Delhi, attended by nearly 2 lakh workers, which was an unprecedented show of strength in recent decades. In that event, BMS declared the beginning of a sustained agitation. The show of strength inspired other trade unions, and on the very next day, their leaders came to the BMS office to plan joint actions, accepting the leadership of BMS. Two nationwide strikes followed on 28th March 2012 and 20-21 February 2013, by all the central Trade Unions together under BMS leadership. These actions had a significant impact, drawing serious attention from the government, employers, media and all those related to labour. For the first time, then Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh directly intervened at the eleventh hour and appointed a group of four ministers to engage with trade unions and address their demands. During the Indian Labour Conference held in Delhi on May 17, 2013, the Prime Minister openly recognised the demands of trade unions, rekindling hope and enthusiasm among workers across the country.\nThe 46th Indian Labour Conference, held on July 20-21, 2015 after a gap of more than two years, marked a turning point amid turbulent labour conditions. During the conference, in a committee on ‘Labour Law Reforms’ chaired by the BMS representative, all three social partners — employers’ organisations, the 11 central trade unions, and government representatives from both the Centre and the States — unanimously agreed upon three foundational pillars for all future labour legislations: (i) the rights and welfare of workers; (ii) the sustainability of enterprises and job creation; and (iii) industrial peace.\nWhen the four Labour Codes were in the drafting stage, a team of BMS activists actively participated in the Government’s consultation process, while other Central Trade Unions belonging to opposition parties chose to boycott it. As a result of BMS’s proactive engagement, several major pro-labour reforms, particularly steps toward the universalisation of labour benefits, were successfully incorporated into the Codes. However, certain clauses still contain provisions that remain a cause of serious concern. Thus, the Code on Wages and the Code on Social Security are considered historic and revolutionary in many respects. Nevertheless, BMS remains committed to its ongoing struggle to amend the anti-worker provisions in the remaining two Codes.\nUnder the leadership of BMS, the Central Trade Unions raised a 12-point joint Charter of Demands (as revised on June 24, 2014) before the Government and declared a national strike on September 2, 2015. In response, the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, constituted a Group of Five Ministers, led by Finance Minister Shri Arun Jaitley, to engage in wide-ranging consultations with all 11 Central Trade Unions regarding the demands. These consultations were held on August 26 and 27, 2015. After extensive discussions, the Government took a historic step by either fully or partially accepting nearly 10 out of the 12 demands. Emphasising the critical role of trade unions, the Finance Minister assured all Central Trade Unions that any labour law reforms would be undertaken only after thorough tripartite consultations. In light of the Government’s proactive efforts to address the Charter of Demands, BMS decided to postpone the strike. However, the central trade unions affiliated with opposition political parties chose to proceed with the strike, despite the majority of demands having been accepted. The strike, without the participation of the BMS, failed to make any significant impact. This development marked a clear separation between “labour welfare” and “labour politics.” Since then, opposition trade unions have continued to organise frequent politically motivated strikes ceremoniously, without BMS involvement and without making any meaningful impact on the labour landscape.\nDuring 2015-2016, the International Labour Organization (ILO) undertook a historic initiative to “formalise the informal sector”, conducting two years of global discussions on the matter. BMS delegate Shri Saji Narayanan C.K. was selected to represent the Asia-Pacific region in the ILO Workers’ Group Steering Team for the two year period. He was invited to attend the key preparatory meeting of the workers’ team held in Copenhagen, organised by the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC), ahead of the ILO Conference.\nIn 2020–21, while the world was in the grip of the COVID-19 pandemic, BMS carried out one of the largest service initiatives in the history of the trade union movement. District-level helplines were established, and extensive service activities were carried out at the grassroots level across the country. Tragically, the BMS lost around 600 of its senior activists in the process.\nBRICS and L20: An Indian voice in the global labour arena\nThe BMS has also taken on a new role in global leadership. In 2016, for the first time, the BMS assumed the Presidency of the BRICS Trade Union Forum. The BRICS conference held in India that year received high praise from international delegates for its organisation and hospitality. In 2021, amid the pandemic, the BRICS TUF conference was once again held, this time online, under BMS’s presidency.\nThe year 2023 was a significant milestone as India hosted the G20 Summit under the Presidency of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Labour20 (L20), one of the key verticals of the summit, was chaired by BMS as India’s largest central trade union. The L20 conference saw participation from representatives of 20+9 countries, making it the most widely represented L20 event to date. During both the BRICS and L20 conferences, the BMS proposed the idea of universalisation (antyodaya) of labour benefits, an idea that received unanimous appreciation and endorsement from all participating countries.\nDuring the Indo-Pak conflict in May 2025, the BMS declared its unwavering support for the soldiers guarding the nation’s borders.\nTowards Antyodaya: A future to be built on firm foundations\nToday, the BMS comprises over 5,700 unions spanning approximately 60 labour sectors. These have been consolidated into 42 all-India federations active across diverse domains. Going forward, India will face two critical challenges in its labour sector: the vast size of the unorganised sector and the growing trend of contractualisation within the organised sector.\nIndia, unfortunately, holds the ignominious distinction of having the world’s largest unorganised labour force. According to government statistics, 93.7% of the working population is in unorganised sector, falling outside the protection of labour laws and social security frameworks. Moreover, the increasing use of contract labour within the organised sector has created a vast number of “islands” of unorganized labour within it. A stagnant manufacturing sector further pressured by the influx of Chinese goods and a non-profitable agricultural economy have placed a disproportionate burden on the already falling real wage levels and deteriorating working conditions of Indian labour.\nAt its 2011 Jalgaon conference, the BMS resolved to focus all efforts on addressing issues in the unorganised sector by launching two key initiatives: ‘March to Villages’ and ‘Organise the Unorganised’. The BMS has established a separate wing for unorganised workers, coordinated by senior members and supported by 12 national-level federations. Among them is the Akhil Bharatiya Vanvasi Gramin Mazdoor Mahasangh, one of the largest tribal federations, actively working in Madhya Pradesh and surrounding states.\nA nation cannot claim development while the majority of its working population languishes in low economic standards, poverty and vulnerability. Therefore, the BMS has steadfastly promoted the philosophy of antyodaya—upliftment of the last worker—as an essential component of its foundational ideology, Ekatma Manav Darshan’. The Bharatiya social order envisioned by Thengadi was deeply rooted in this concept.\nOver the decades, the BMS has played a vital role in transforming India’s labour sector and will continue this struggle until the vision of antyodaya is fully realised.\nSaji Narayanan CK is Former President, Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh.

    "title": "'Trafficked to Dubai, Raped in Oman': The Sordid Saga of a Woman Seeking a Job",
    "content": "Trigger Warning: Mentions of sexual harassment, trafficking, attempted suicide. The survivor's name has been changed to protect her identity. Remember how it's like to be 21? Full of energy, a drive to do something worthwhile, to prove yourself, find a good job, earn a decent salary, and be independent. Diksha* (name changed) was all this and more. As the elder daughter, she wanted to support her family—her father is a mason and mother a homemaker. Having studied only till Class 8, Diksha wanted to help pay for the education of her younger sister, who is now in Class 12. Her village in Assam’s Chirang district, located near the India-Bhutan border, has little to no job opportunities. Diksha had to move out. An agent, Bikash, approached Diksha with a job offer in Dubai and assured her that he’ll take care of the paperwork. At the time, Diksha had no clue what she was setting out for.Diksha was allegedly trafficked to Dubai, forced into domestic servitude, exploited as a bonded labourer and trafficked again to Oman, where her employer allegedly raped her. Just as she was about to give in to her fate, she managed to sneak a call to Manobal Foundation, a Delhi-based NGO that helps in rescuing survivors of sex trafficking.When Diksha was repatriated to India on 7 July, she was 23. She had lost two prime years of her youth to the worst horrors imaginable. This is not only Diksha’s story but of numerous Indian women, who have come forward with testimonies of trafficking, sexual abuse and slavery—all starting with a false promise of a decent job. In fact, in 2024, nearly 2,000 complaints were registered by Indian migrant workers at Indian Missions in Oman, while over 3,700 such complaints were registered in UAE, as per a Parliament response on 7 February this year. And these don’t include people like Diksha, who were trafficked and entered the countries through unofficial channels. The Quint has consistently been reporting on the issue of cross-border labour trafficking and job scams. Read our work under Naukri Crisis and support us by becoming a member.“My badi mummy (mother’s aunt) had introduced me to Bikash. She asked me to friend him on Facebook as he had previously found jobs for people in Dubai. I told him I wanted to work as a server in a fast-food restaurant,” Diksha told The Quint.Bikash purportedly offered her a job as a housekeeper in Dubai. He promised a salary of Rs 20,000-22,000 per month. When Diksha agreed, Bikash had all her documents, including a tourist visa, ready within 15 days. It is important to note here that unscrupulous agents often target the naïve and desperate through an acquaintance and fly their victims on tourist visas (the official channel requires ECR Passport) to evade the law.“I had never taken a flight to another country before. So, Bikash rehearsed answers with me for immigration at the airports. I was supposed to say – I'm here to visit – and say it with confidence,” Diksha recalled. She said that she was nervous but composed herself with the thought that people in Dubai are no different than people in India. Diksha landed in Dubai late in September 2023. She was allegedly received by a married Indian couple—Arjun and Noor—who instantly took away her passport and phone and drove her to their apartment.“I was asked to record a video bio data in English. They uploaded the video online to find me a sponsor,” Diksha said. For a migrant worker to be employed as a housekeeper in Dubai, rules dictate that the employer sponsors the worker’s visa, accommodation, salary and overall wellbeing, which includes health insurance and vacation days. Unscrupulous agents, however, circumvent these rules to offer cheap labour. “Once they found a sponsor, they sent me to his house. I started working every day from 4 am—cleaning the house, taking care of their five children and washing their clothes,” recollected Diksha, who was 21 then. She wasn’t allowed to leave her employer’s house at all and got a rest of 30 minutes, in which she was fed leftovers of the day. Exhausted, she called the couple and pleaded them to send her back to India. “But the agents demanded Rs 3 lakh from me to leave, saying they had paid Bikash to bring me to Dubai. I was shocked to hear that Bikash had sold me,” Diksha claimed. Not having the desired sum, she was compelled to work. “They kept exploiting me, I kept working,” she added.Diksha’s struggles took a turn for the worse when her employers in Dubai stopped paying her wages and months later, abandoned her. Although the agents took her in, they continuously threatened her. “I used to get my phone only for 10 minutes daily, only to speak to my mother and ask for the money. But we didn’t have that much money,” Diksha said. The agents kept her at their apartment for 15 days, after which, they sent her to Oman on a tourist visa. Diksha was again made to rehearse answers for immigration officers at the airports – “I was supposed to say I am visiting an elderly relative.” After she landed in Oman, Diksha was directly picked up by her sponsor, who immediately took away her passport and phone. In Oman, the Kafala system of sponsorship ties migrants’ visas to their sponsor, preventing them from changing jobs or quitting or leaving the country. Although Oman introduced labour reforms in 2023, migrant domestic workers were not included. At his house, Diksha again toiled for 16-18 hours daily for months, occasionally receiving her wages. She kept hopping from one sponsor to another, until she was exhausted. Diksha couldn’t have returned to India until she paid off the agents. “Then a Sri Lankan man Arham Mohammed, who used to work at the agent’s office in Oman, started talking to me in Hindi. He offered to help me earn the money. Desperate to go home, I agreed,” Diksha told The Quint. She claimed that Arham took her to his house and locked her in a room with a packet of bread and a bottle of water. Three days later, she was sent to another sponsor in Sohar city of Oman.“I had been sold again. The sponsor and his friend raped me every day for months. I had to be hospitalised twice; they took me to clinics where no one would ask for IDs,” Diksha alleged. She added that she couldn’t tell anyone because they had taken away her phone. Broken, she tried to end her life. In a last-ditch effort, she found her phone. Though it didn’t have a sim, she managed to log into TikTok and contact her friend, who then called Nirmala Walter of Manobal Foundation in Delhi. \"I first spoke to Diksha on the night of 15 June and asked her to share her location. Then I looked up NGOs and authorities in Oman that could help rescue her,” Nirmala told The Quint. She also reached out to Impulse NGO Network (INGON), a Meghalaya-based organisation working against human trafficking and exploitation. Bari, Case Manager and Team Lead at INGON, said, “Diksha’s case came to us on 19 June. We immediately spurred into action—called an Oman-based portal, the embassies, wrote to SP of Chirang District, the Director General of Police as well as to Assam’s chief minister.” The portal, called Combatting Human Trafficking, acknowledged the complaint and within five days, the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) of the Royal Oman Police rescued Diksha.She was allegedly held at the police station for a couple of days, after which her case was transferred to the labour court. “The Indian Embassy informed us that Diksha had been sent to a detention centre in Muscat and that since her passport was still with her agents, she would be issued an Emergency White Passport for her repatriation,” Bari told The Quint.Diksha was repatriated on 7 July and is now recuperating with her mother and sister in Nepal. “I’ve learnt my lesson and that is to never give up and never lose hope. I will fight for my rights and find a job in my country,” Diksha said, a lump in her throat. Meanwhile, Bari informed The Quint that a formal complaint has been lodged against Bikash in Chirang. The Quint has reached out to the Royal Oman Police as well as the Indian Embassy in Oman and will update the story once they respond.",

    "title": "Patna News : Airport May Soon See International Flights to 18 Countries, Says Government in Rajya Sabha",
    "content": "Patna Airport could soon be connected to 18 international destinations, as discussions gain momentum in Parliament. BJP Rajya Sabha MP Dr. Bhim Singh raised the issue of launching international flights from Patna\"s Jay Prakash Narayan International Airport, highlighting the growing demand and potential of the region. Responding to the matter in the Rajya Sabha, the Union Civil Aviation Minister stated that while the airport is technically ready for international operations, the actual launch of flights depends on their economic viability. The minister added that international flight operations will begin only when they are found to be financially sustainable for airlines. MP Urges Government to Take Action Dr. Bhim Singh urged the Central Government to take proactive steps to start international services from Patna, considering the increasing passenger traffic and the large number of people from Bihar residing abroad, particularly in the Gulf and Southeast Asia. He also emphasized that direct connectivity to international destinations would not only boost convenience for passengers but also promote trade, tourism, and investment in Bihar. 18 Countries in the Pipeline Though specific routes have not been finalized, sources suggest that flight proposals could include destinations in the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Nepal, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, and Bangladesh, among others. The proposal is part of a broader plan to expand air connectivity under the UDAN international scheme and improve airport infrastructure in tier-2 cities. Airport Infrastructure Already Upgraded Officials noted that Patna Airport has undergone significant infrastructure upgrades, including an extended runway, upgraded terminal facilities, and enhanced security systems, making it capable of handling international traffic. The Airports Authority of India (AAI) has already completed several phases of modernization, and airlines are being encouraged to explore viable international routes from the city. Conclusion: While Patna Airport is ready to handle international flights, the government clarified that the launch will depend on airline interest and economic feasibility. If airlines find sufficient demand and operational profitability, the capital city of Bihar may soon be connected directly to several global destinations.",

    "title": "Exclusive: Trump's funding cut stalls water projects, increasing risks for millions - Reuters",
    "content": "SummaryFunding cutoff leaves wells, irrigation canals, other projects half builtMillions left without promised clean water and sanitation facilitiesWater projects enjoyed broad support in Washington\n\nTAVETA, Kenya, July 19 (Reuters) - The Trump administration's decision to slash nearly all U.S. foreign aid has left dozens of water and sanitation projects half-finished across the globe, creating new hazards for some of the people they were designed to benefit, Reuters has found.\n\nReuters has identified 21 unfinished projects in 16 countries after speaking to 17 sources familiar with the infrastructure plans. Most of these projects have not previously been reported.\n\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\n\nWith hundreds of millions of dollars in funding cancelled since January, workers have put down their shovels and left holes half dug and building supplies unguarded, according to interviews with U.S. and local officials and internal documents seen by Reuters.\n\nAs a result, millions of people who were promised clean drinking water and reliable sanitation facilities by the United States have been left to fend for themselves.\n\nWater towers intended to serve schools and health clinics in Mali have been abandoned, according to two U.S. officials who spoke on condition of anonymity. In Nepal, construction was halted on more than 100 drinking water systems, leaving plumbing supplies and 6,500 bags of cement in local communities. The Himalayan nation will use its own funds to finish the job, according to the country's water minister Pradeep Yadav.\n\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\n\nIn Lebanon, a project to provide cheap solar power to water utilities was scrapped, costing some 70 people their jobs and halting plans to improve regional services. The utilities are now relying on diesel and other sources to power their services, said Suzy Hoayek, an adviser to Lebanon's energy ministry.\n\nIn Kenya, residents of Taita Taveta County say they are now more vulnerable to flooding than they had been before, as half-finished irrigation canals could collapse and sweep away crops. Community leaders say it will cost $2,000 to lower the risk – twice the average annual income in the area.\n\n\"I have no protection from the flooding that the canal will now cause. The floods will definitely get worse,\" said farmer Mary Kibachia, 74.\n\nBIPARTISAN SUPPORT\n\nTrump’s dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development has left life-saving food and medical aid rotting in warehouses and thrown humanitarian efforts around the world into turmoil. The cuts may cause an additional 14 million deaths by 2030, according to research published in The Lancet medical journal.\n\nThe Trump administration and its supporters argue that the United States should spend its money to benefit Americans at home rather than sending it abroad, and say USAID had strayed from its original mission by funding projects like LGBT rights in Serbia.\n\nWith an annual budget of $450 million, the U.S. water projects accounted for a small fraction of the $61 billion in foreign aid distributed by the United States last year.\n\nBefore Trump's reelection in November, the water projects had not been controversial in Washington. A 2014 law that doubled funding passed both chambers of Congress unanimously.\n\nAdvocates say the United States has over the years improved the lives of tens of millions of people by building pumps, irrigation canals, toilets and other water and sanitation projects. That means children are less likely to die of water-borne diseases like diarrhea, girls are more likely to stay in school, and young men are less likely to be recruited by extremist groups, said John Oldfield, a consultant and lobbyist for water infrastructure projects.\n\n“Do we want girls carrying water on their heads for their families? Or do you want them carrying school books?” he said.\n\nThe U.S. State Department, which has taken over foreign aid from USAID, did not respond to a request for comment about the impact of halting the water projects.\n\nThe agency has restored some funding for life-saving projects, but Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said American assistance will be more limited going forward.\n\nAt least one water project has been restarted. Funding for a $6 billion desalination plant in Jordan was restored after a diplomatic push by King Abdullah.\n\nBut the funding cuts to other projects mean women in those areas will have to walk for hours to collect unsafe water, children will face increased disease risk and health facilities will be shuttered, said Tjada D’Oyen McKenna, CEO of Mercy Corps, a nonprofit that worked with USAID on water projects in Congo, Nigeria and Afghanistan that were intended to benefit 1.7 million people.\n\n“This isn’t just the loss of aid — it’s the unraveling of progress, stability, and human dignity,” she said.\n\nThe United States is not the only country to limit its foreign assistance, citing domestic priorities. Britain, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden have also made cuts.\n\nItem 1 of 10 Women wash clothes at the shores of lake Kivu, following the water shortage at Bosco Lac, where the water connections were supposed to supply the city's western quarters that were halted following USAID funding cuts to the NGO Mercy Corps in Goma, North Kivu province, Democratic Republic of Congo, June 16, 2025.

All this is because of the lack of water,” the mother of nine said, without providing specifics.\n\nReuters was unable to confirm her account of such attacks.\n\nA spokesperson for the Congolese government did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn Kenya, USAID was in the midst of a five-year, $100 million project that aimed to provide drinking water and irrigation systems for 150,000 people when contractors and staffers were told in January to stop their work, according to internal documents seen by Reuters. Only 15% of the work had been completed at that point, according to a May 15 memo by DAI Global LLC, the contractor on the project.\n\nThat has left open trenches and deep holes that pose acute risks for children and livestock and left $100,000 worth of pipes, fencing and other materials exposed at construction sites, where they could degrade or be looted, according to other correspondence seen by Reuters. USAID signage at those sites makes clear who is responsible for the half-finished work, several memos say.\n\nThat could hurt the United States' reputation and potentially give a boost to extremist groups seeking fresh recruits in the region, according to a draft memo from the U.S. embassy in Nairobi to the State Department seen by Reuters. Reuters could not confirm if the memo was sent and if revisions were made to it prior to sending. The State Department did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe al Qaeda-linked al Shabaab group based in Somalia has been responsible for a string of high-profile attacks in Kenya, including an assault on a university in 2015 that killed at least 147 people.\n\n\"The reputational risk of not finishing these projects could turn into a security risk,\" the memo said.\n\nAl Shabaab could not be immediately reached for comment. The Kenyan government did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nDAMAGING FLOODS\n\nIn Kenya's Taita Taveta, a largely rural county that has endured cyclical drought and flooding, workers had only managed to build brick walls along 220 metres of the 3.1-kilometre (1.9 mile) irrigation canal when they were ordered to stop, community leaders said. And those walls have not been plastered, leaving them vulnerable to erosion.\n\n“Without plaster, the walls will collapse in heavy rain, and the flow of water will lead to the destruction of farms,” said Juma Kubo, a community leader.\n\nThe community has asked the Kenyan government and international donors to help finish the job, at a projected cost of 68 million shillings ($526,000).\n\nIn the meantime, they plan to sell the cement and steel cables left on site, Kubo said, to raise money to plaster and backfill the canal.\n\nThe county government needs to find \"funds to at least finish the project to the degree we can with the materials we have, if not complete it fully,\" said Stephen Kiteto Mwagoti, an irrigation officer working for the county.\n\nThe Kenyan government did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nFor Kibachia, who has lived with flooding for years, help cannot come soon enough.\n\nThree months after work stopped on the project, her mud hut was flooded with thigh-deep water.\n\nReporting by Ammu Kannampilly in Nairobi and Taveta, Kenya and Andy Sullivan in Washington; additional reporting by Sabiti Djaffar in Mugunga, Democratic Republic of Congo, Gopal Sharma in Kathmandu and Maya Gebeily, Joelle Kozaily and Ahmad al-Kerdi in Beirut; Editing by Don Durfee and Deepa Babington\n\nPurchase Licensing Rights\n\nAmmu KannampillyThomson ReutersAmmu Kannampilly joined Reuters in 2024 and manages news coverage of 14 countries across East Africa and the Indian Ocean.

    "content": "Left-wing organizations linked financially to George and Alexander Soros’s Open Society Foundations are suing President Donald Trump’s administration, claiming illegal aliens at Florida’s “Alligator Alcatraz” detention center are having their First and Fifth Amendment rights violated.\n\nA lawsuit from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), representing a handful of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and illegal aliens, is asking a federal judge to issue a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction against Trump’s Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for allegedly violating the so-called due process rights of Alligator Alcatraz detainees.\n\n“This facility opens another dark chapter in our nation’s history. Its very existence is predicated on our country’s basest impulses and shows the danger of unchecked governmental authority when combined with unbridled hate,” the ACLU’s Eunice Choo said:\n\nIt represents an attack on common decency, and in this case, its treatment of detained people is also unlawful. The U.S. Constitution does not allow the government to simply lock people away without any ability to communicate with counsel or to petition the court for release from custody. The government may not trample on these most fundamental protections for people held in its custody.\n\nThe lawsuit claims the Trump administration is violating the First and Fifth Amendment rights of about 700 illegal aliens currently held at Alligator Alcatraz by allegedly banning in-person legal visitation, confidential communications, and confidential exchanges of documents.\n\nACLU lawyers have said Alligator Alcatraz is cruel because of its proximity to alligators, pythons, mosquitoes, and swampland.\n\nAside from the ACLU, the ACLU of Florida and Americans for Immigrant Justice are involved in the lawsuit, representing such organizations and illegal aliens.\n\nWhile Americans for Immigrant Justice accepted $25,000 in grants from Soros’s Open Society Foundations in 2017, the ACLU has raked in millions from the Soros network over the years.\n\nIn 2023, the ACLU Foundation of Florida received more than a quarter of a million dollars from the Open Society Foundations. In 2022, American Civil Liberties Union, Inc. took a whopping $15 million from the Open Society Foundations.\n\nMost recently, groups linked to the Soros network filed a lawsuit to prevent Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents from arresting illegal aliens at courthouses. Also this month, Soros-linked groups filed a lawsuit to stop DHS from ending Temporary Protected Status for migrants from Honduras, Nicaragua, and Nepal.\n\nThe case is C.M. v.

The move is part of their preparations for the ICC T20 World Cup qualifiers scheduled for October this year. The Indian government is backing this initiative as a way to connect the youth of the two countries. This is not the first time Nepal's team is training at the BCCI's Centre of Excellence. The Indian government had also facilitated a similar training session in August last year. In addition, Nepal played the triangular T20 tournament against Baroda and Gujarat last year. The tournament was organized ahead of the 2024 T20 Cricket Cup. An Indian government official emphasized that cricket cooperation has added a new dimension to the deep-rooted and age-old historical ties between India and Nepal. The official said it connects the youth of both countries through a shared passion for cricket. External Affairs Minister Dr. S Jaishankar had met with the Nepalese men's cricket team and representatives of the Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN) in January 2024, conveying India's support for cricket development in Nepal. The Indian government also backed a practice tournament between the Nepal Under-19 sides and the Delhi & District Cricket Association in March this year. Meanwhile, the Nepal women's side took part in a preparation camp in Delhi from April to May for the Asia World Cup Qualifiers in Thailand. The team made it to the finals of these qualifiers.

    "title": "The quiet Asian engagement everyone should be watching",
    "content": "In mid-July, Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar visited China for the first time in nearly six years, underlining a tentative yet important reset in relations between Asia’s two major powers. Jaishankar met with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Foreign Minister Wang Yi, and Vice-President Han Zheng in Beijing. Although the visit did not bring about a radical breakthrough, it did mark a significant step toward restoring top-level engagement and inching toward normalization. This effort comes at a symbolic moment – the 75th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two nations – and reflects a broader duality: a blend of gradual rapprochement alongside enduring strategic competition.\n\nJaishankar, who since 2019 has represented the moderate and pragmatic wing within India’s foreign policy establishment, continues to advocate for cooperation with China and broader engagement in multilateral institutions such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) and BRICS. His presence in Beijing was emblematic of India’s effort to rebalance its approach to its complex relationship with its northern neighbor.\n\nThe relevance of Sino-Indian relations extends far beyond bilateral dynamics. China and India are the world’s two most populous countries, belonging to fastest-growing economies. Both are ancient civilizations and increasingly influential actors in the rising Global South. As such, their ability to manage tensions and cultivate areas of cooperation carries profound implications for regional and global order.\n\nRecently, there have been meaningful achievements in the bilateral relationship. Political dialogue and high-level engagement have resumed, contributing to greater border stability through new measures. Exchanges in various sectors and regional connectivity initiatives have intensified. Economic interdependence remains strong, and coordination between the two countries in multilateral platforms such as the SCO and the United Nations has become more robust.\n\nA landmark event occurred in October 2024, when Chinese President Xi and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met in Kazan. This meeting marked the beginning of a new phase of engagement. Notably, the positive trajectory of relations was not disrupted by the India-Pakistan conflict in May – a testament to the growing political will on both sides to deepen ties.\n\nEconomic interaction also continues to flourish. In 2024, China reclaimed its position as India’s top trading partner, surpassing the United States after a two-year hiatus. Bilateral trade reached $118.4 billion, a 4% increase from 2023. These figures underscore a deepening interdependence that provides both leverage and incentive for sustained dialogue.\n\nFrom Beijing’s perspective, the deterioration in relations over the past few years is seen as abnormal. Chinese officials have consistently promoted the idea of improvement across multiple dimensions. India is frequently described in Chinese discourse as a fellow ancient Eastern civilization, and the bilateral relationship has been metaphorically referred to as the “dragon-elephant tango,” a symbolic framing that seeks to capture the potential harmony between the two powers.\n\nChina sees India as an indispensable actor in the Global South and advocates for a bilateral relationship that is not directed against any third party – mirroring the same language used in reference to China’s strategic partnership with Russia. Both China and India promote the vision of a multipolar world, multilateralism, and economic globalization. In this context, parallels are drawn between Xi’s vision of “a community with a shared future for mankind” and Modi’s concept of “Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam” (“the world is one family”), which is rooted in ancient Indian philosophy and emphasizes harmony and interconnectedness. The Chinese-launched Global Civilization Initiative also seeks to revive pre-modern cultural frameworks and plurality of civilizations, aligning conceptually with similar trends in India.\n\nDuring his meetings in Beijing, Jaishankar reiterated India’s principle of strategic autonomy and its independent foreign policy – an approach that resonates with China’s own diplomatic posture. He described India and China as development partners rather than rivals, countering dominant Western narratives that frame China-India relations largely through the lens of competition and threat.\n\nThe triangular dynamic involving the US complicates the picture. Current pressures from Washington – particularly the shared risk of a trade war and the volatility of US foreign policy – act as a common concern for both New Delhi and Beijing. India, China, and other BRICS nations are facing increased scrutiny from the White House and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, who have threatened secondary sanctions over continued economic ties with Russia. These external pressures may inadvertently bring China and India closer together, as both seek to safeguard their strategic autonomy and development trajectories.\n\nHistorically, the US has sought to exploit gaps between India and China in a bid to prevent closer cooperation. That strategy may be less effective in an era where both Beijing and New Delhi are increasingly conscious of the need to define their relationship on their own terms.\n\nDespite these positive trends, substantial challenges remain. Chief among them is the unresolved boundary dispute, which remains the most sensitive and complex issue in the bilateral relationship. The Galwan Valley clash in 2020, which resulted in around two dozen fatalities, caused a severe deterioration in ties. However, the June 2025 visit of Indian Defense Minister Rajnath Singh to China signaled a renewed willingness to seek a permanent resolution.\n\nTrade-related frictions also persist. India faces restrictions on the import of rare earth magnets from China, which are crucial for strategic and industrial sectors. Intermittent Chinese export controls disrupt Indian manufacturing and deter Chinese foreign direct investment. Conversely, India restricts Chinese investment citing national security concerns, has banned several Chinese apps, and conducted raids on Chinese companies.\n\nGeopolitically, the competition for regional influence continues to strain relations. China’s growing presence in South Asia and the Indian Ocean clashes with India’s strategic interests, especially in countries like Bhutan, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. India has consistently refused to join the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), largely due to its opposition to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), which runs through contested territory. Plans for massive infrastructure projects such as the construction of the world’s largest dam on the Yarlung Zangbo river, which flows into India, remain points of tension.\n\nTo move beyond these obstacles, it is essential to build a stable and effective border trust mechanism. Restoring strategic dialogue platforms and enhancing multi-level security cooperation are indispensable steps toward creating a mature and resilient bilateral relationship. What is required is long-term, sustained, and measurable interaction supported by enduring political will, pragmatic consultative frameworks, and – above all – mutual respect for each other’s core interests.\n\nAt a more practical level, the two countries could reconsider the potential of the China-Nepal-India Economic Corridor (CNIEC). Proposed by Beijing in 2018 and backed by Kathmandu, the CNIEC envisions greater connectivity and economic integration across the Himalayan region. Though India has so far rejected the proposal, revisiting it could offer shared economic and strategic benefits.\n\nAnother concrete step would be the restoration of military exercises, which were launched in 2007 but suspended after 2019. Renewed military cooperation would enhance strategic trust and transparency. Additionally, greater coordination in hydro-political domain is vital. Seven major rivers originate in China’s Xizang region and flow through India. This creates both risks and opportunities for the two nations.\n\nWhile a full normalization of China-India relations may still be distant, the latest developments point toward a cautious but real shift. In a global context marked by uncertainty, polarization, and geopolitical realignment, the two Asian giants have much to gain from pragmatic engagement and mutual respect. The dragon and the elephant may still step on each other’s toes, but their carefully choreographed tango is once again underway.",

A bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi called the situation \"unacceptable\" and observed \"gross contempt of court\".

We will be passing some harsh order and direct for issuing a Red Corner notice and then authorities will have to act,\" the bench said. Additional Solicitor General Aishwarya Bhati, appearing for the Centre and Delhi Police, said the Ministry of External Affairs and the police officials were in touch with officials of the Indian embassy.

She said it came to the notice through IP address of emails that first she left with a minor to Nepal via Bihar and then took a flight to Sharjah and then to Russia. \"We are still investigating the matter and would like to ascertain a few other things before filing a status report,\" Bhati said. The bench directed Delhi Police to file a comprehensive status report in a week. On July 18, the Delhi police claimed in the top court that the Russian mother has not left the country, at least through legal means. The father is fighting the custody battle for the child with the estranged Russian woman and alleged she wasn't complying with the court's order of custody of the minor. The man claimed the whereabouts of the woman and his child were unknown. On July 17, the top court directed senior Delhi Police officials to immediately trace a child and asked the Centre to issue a look out notice with regard to the woman and the minor to ensure she did not leave the country. The mother of the child is a Russian citizen, who has been residing in India since 2019, initially coming to India on an X-1 Visa, which expired subsequently. However, during the pendency of the court proceedings, the top court directed the extension of the visa from time to time.

    "title": "Opinion | Rebirth Or Rebranding? Reincarnation Under Surveillance",
    "content": "The question of who will be recognised as the 15th reincarnation of His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama is not merely a matter of religious tradition—it is a litmus test for the global community’s commitment to spiritual freedom and cultural autonomy.\nAt the epicentre of this issue lies a stark confrontation: between the Tibetan Buddhist tradition, rooted in centuries of spiritual wisdom, and the People’s Republic of China, whose bureaucratic apparatus seeks to politicise reincarnation itself.\nChina’s 2007 directives on the management of reincarnated lamas—mandating state approval and invoking the archaic ‘Golden Urn’ method—are not only a distortion of Tibetan religious practice but a calculated attempt to subjugate faith under authoritarian control. These measures, cloaked in the language of regulation, are instruments of ideological domination, designed to erode the spiritual sovereignty of Tibet and replace it with state-sanctioned orthodoxy.\nThe Buddhist Renaissance, initiated in the wake of systemic religious restrictions, has unfolded within a contested ideological space, marked by fundamentally differing visions of religion’s role in contemporary Tibet. The institution of reincarnation (Tib. trulku, sprul sku) is one of the central concepts in not only the Buddhist but almost all Indic traditions with saṃsāra, as the vicious cycle of birth, death, and rebirth. This cycle, according to Buddhist doctrine, is ceaseless and infinite in duration, encompassing all sentient beings until they attain nirvāṇa. Progression through this cycle is determined by one’s moral conduct and karmic accumulation. As part of this cultural and religious synthesis, the concept of the trulku—a consciously reincarnated spiritual master—became a hallmark of Tibetan Buddhism.\nDuring the Second Dissemination (phyi dar) of Buddhism in Tibet in the late 10th and early 11th centuries, a process of institutionalisation of Buddhism within Tibetan society and the emergence of distinct Tibetan Buddhist schools also bloomed. Unlike ordinary beings who are subject to involuntary rebirth within saṃsāra, Tulkus are believed to be spiritually realised individuals who, having transcended the cycle of existence, choose to reincarnate voluntarily. Their return in physical form is seen as an act of compassion, intended to benefit sentient beings and further the Dharma. The three kayas thus are:\n\nDharmakāya (Truth Body): The eternal, formless essence of the Buddha, representing ultimate reality and transcending both physical and spiritual dimensions.\nSambhogakāya (Enjoyment Body): The celestial manifestation of Buddhas and bodhisattvas, perceptible only to advanced practitioners who have attained a high level of spiritual realization.\nNirmāṇakāya (Emanation Body; Tib. trulku): The physical form through which Buddhas and Bodhisattvas appear in the human realm to guide sentient beings toward liberation.\n\nThe most prominent and influential reincarnation lineages in the Gelugpa tradition of Tibetan Buddhism are the Dalai Lamas (tā la’i bla ma) and the Panchen Lamas (paṇ chen bla ma). The Dalai Lama is revered as the manifestation of the bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara, the spiritual protector of the Tibetan people, while the Panchen Lama is regarded as the embodiment of Buddha Amitābha.\nThe rise of the Gelug school in the 17th century represented a turning point in Tibetan religious and political history. Under the leadership of figures such as the Fifth Dalai Lama, the Gelug tradition consolidated power and became the dominant force in Tibetan Buddhism. With growing support from Mongol patrons and increasing centralization of authority in Lhasa, the school undertook an ambitious program of institutional expansion. As Gelug influence extended across the Tibetan plateau and beyond, this power shift brought about a dramatic increase in monastic construction. Dozens—eventually hundreds—of new monasteries were founded throughout Central Tibet, Amdo, Kham, and even parts of Mongolia and China. These institutions not only served religious functions but also became local centers of education, administration, and cultural life.\nCrucially, with the expansion of monastic infrastructure came the proliferation of tulku lineages—hereditary reincarnations of spiritually accomplished lamas. Many of these tulkus were recognised within individual monasteries and functioned primarily at the local level, acting as spiritual leaders and ensuring continuity within their institutions. Though these lineages did not possess the sweeping authority of the Dalai or Panchen Lamas, they were deeply influential within their regional and sectarian contexts. This system also reflected a broader theological and political strategy: While this created a rich and intricate web of spiritual leadership, one in which the influence of most was localised, even as a few achieved pan-Tibetan recognition, like the authority of the Dalai and Panchen Lamas, whose influence extended as far as Mongolia.\nThe conflict over the recognition of Tulkus—reincarnate Tibetan Buddhist leaders—reached a flashpoint in 1995, centering on the succession of the 10th Panchen Lama, who passed away in January 1989 at Tashilhünpo Monastery in Shigatse. The dispute intensified in May 1995, when the 14th Dalai Lama recognized Gendün Chökyi Nyima (b. 1989) as the 11th Panchen Lama. The 1995 abduction of Gendün Chökyi Nyima, the Dalai Lama’s recognised 11th Panchen Lama, remains one of the most egregious violations of religious freedom in modern history. His disappearance, followed by the installation of a politically compliant proxy, Gyaltsen Norbu, underscores Beijing’s intent: to control not only the narrative of Tibetan Buddhism but its future leadership. It is noteworthy that a substantial number of Tibetans—both within Tibet and across the global diaspora—do not acknowledge him as a legitimate reincarnated tulku. This sentiment reflects long-standing concerns about the authenticity of religious appointments made or endorsed under political authority, rather than through traditional spiritual processes.\nChina, as a one-party state led by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), maintains an officially atheist stance. Historically, CCP leadership has often characterised religious belief as incompatible with Marxist-Leninist ideology. Famously, Mao Zedong once referred to religion as “poison”, a reflection of the party’s foundational skepticism toward organized spiritual practice. Although the state now allows limited religious expression under strict regulatory frameworks, many observers note that such policies prioritize ideological conformity over genuine religious freedom. In China, thus Buddha Dhamma is often perceived less as a religious tradition and more as a cultural artifact. China’s treatment of Buddhism reveals a stark contradiction. While the state elevates the Buddhist Association of China (BAC) as a legitimate voice in global religious forums, it simultaneously enacts policies that dismantle authentic Buddhist practice—particularly in Tibetan regions. Monasteries are demolished, spiritual leaders are silenced, and reincarnation processes are manipulated to serve political ends. This dual strategy—legitimising state-controlled Buddhism while suppressing independent religious expression—reflects a calculated erosion of religious freedom under the guise of cultural stewardship. Additionally, the Sinicisation of Buddha Dhamma by the Chinese state, under the guise of cultural integration, increasingly appears to be a calculated effort to subordinate a transnational spiritual tradition to the ideological apparatus of the Communist Party. While China asserts its sovereign right to shape religious expression within its borders, the systematic reinterpretation of Buddhist teachings to align with ‘socialist core values’ and ‘Xi Jinping Thought’ undermines the doctrinal integrity of the Dhamma and erodes its universal spiritual message. This politicized transformation—framed as modernization—risks reducing Buddha Dhamma to a tool of state propaganda, marginalizing authentic practice, and silencing centuries of pluralistic discourse. The complex interplay between state governance and Tibetan spiritual identity continues to evoke international concern and scholarly debate. It raises fundamental questions about cultural autonomy, spiritual legitimacy, and the appropriate role of political institutions in matters of faith.\nShould China attempt to replicate this maneuver with the Dalai Lama’s succession, it will not only provoke spiritual outrage but geopolitical consequences. India, home to the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan government-in-exile, stands at the crossroads of principle and pragmatism. Any reincarnation recognized on foreign soil would be a direct rebuke to China’s claim of religious jurisdiction—a move that could redefine the contours of Chinese diplomacy.\nIn response, the Chinese government conducted its selection process in November 1995 at Lhasa’s Jokhang Temple, proclaiming Gyaltsen Norbu (b. 1990) as the state-sanctioned 11th Panchen Lama, who was formally enthroned the following month at Tashilhünpo. The Chinese appointed Panchen Lama is barely accepted by the people of Tibet who consider it compelling to attend his events; thus remaining largely unconvinced by his public engagements. There is an overwhelming resistance among the people of Tibet to accept the Chinese appointed Panchen Lama. Gendün Chökyi Nyima has remained disappeared since 1995 and is widely believed to be under state detention, where he continues to be regarded by most Tibetans as the rightful Panchen Lama. The Chinese government’s unilateral appointment of its own Panchen Lama in 1995—following the disappearance of Gendün Chökyi Nyima, the Dalai Lama’s recognised successor—was not merely a breach of religious protocol. It was a calculated maneuver to assert ideological control over Tibetan Buddhism and undermine the spiritual agency of the Tibetan people. This act, condemned internationally, continues to reverberate as a symbol of Beijing’s disregard for religious freedom and cultural autonomy. The Panchen Lama’s sacred role in identifying the next Dalai Lama makes this interference particularly glaring. By installing a state-sanctioned figure, China has positioned itself to manipulate the future of Tibetan spiritual leadership—a move widely viewed as an attempt to rewrite centuries-old traditions to suit political ends. Should Beijing replicate this strategy in selecting the 15th Dalai Lama, the consequences will be profound. Such a decision would not only deepen Tibetan resistance but also provoke diplomatic backlash from nations with historical and cultural ties to Tibet—most notably India, which hosts the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan government-in-exile. The international community must recognize this moment for what it is: a struggle not just over a religious figure, but over the right of a people to preserve their faith, identity, and history. To remain silent is to tacitly endorse the commodification of spirituality by a regime that views religion as a tool of control.\nForemost among the stakeholders is the Gaden Phodrang, the institution established by the 14th Dalai Lama and based in Dharamshala, India. The Dalai Lama has declared that this trust will be the legitimate authority in determining his reincarnation. The Tibetan diaspora, spread across India, Nepal, Bhutan, and much of the Western world, plays a vital role in safeguarding the cultural and religious integrity of Tibetan Buddhism. Many members of the diaspora argue that the next Dalai Lama should be born outside Chinese influence—preferably in a free country where religious practice is not controlled. Their advocacy and support have encouraged the 14th Dalai Lama to outline clear principles for his succession, including the possibility that the institution may end if not viewed as meaningful by Tibetans themselves. The Chinese government claims authority over all Buddhist reincarnations under its jurisdiction, insisting on using the historical ‘Golden Urn’ method to select the next Dalai Lama. However, many Tibetans inside China continue to revere the Dalai Lama and have sent private appeals urging him to ensure the continuation of the institution. Though public expression is tightly monitored, subtle forms of spiritual dissent endure, making Tibetans inside Tibet vulnerable stakeholders. Mongolia has a longstanding spiritual link with Tibet, rooted in the Cho-yon (patron-priest) relationship. Mongolian Buddhists largely follow the Gelug tradition, of which the Dalai Lama is the head. In recent years, the Dalai Lama’s recognition of the 10th Jebtsundamba Khutuktu in Mongolia reaffirmed these connections. Mongolia’s spiritual infrastructure and historical reverence for Tibetan Buddhism make it a key stakeholder—some even speculate it could be a site for the 15th Dalai Lama’s birth. The term ‘Dalai Lama’ itself comes from the Mongolian word meaning Ocean of Wisdom. In 1578, Mongol ruler Altan Khan conferred the title upon Sonam Gyatso, the third leader of the Gelug school of Tibetan Buddhism. This retroactively made him the 3rd Dalai Lama, and the two previous leaders were posthumously recognized as the 1st and 2nd.\nIn Russia, (three republics—Kalmykia, Buryatia, and Tuva)—form a distinct cluster of Tibetan Buddhist (Gelugpa) regions. Despite political challenges and restrictions on the Dalai Lama’s visits, spiritual relations remain strong. These provinces have expressed support for his teachings, and some local leaders have voiced concern over external interference in the reincarnation process. The growing spiritual and cultural dialogue between Russian Buddhists and the Tibetan Gelugpa tradition has been further strengthened through the visits of esteemed masters such as Ling Rinpoche and Kundeling Rinpoche to Russia. These engagements represent a significant step in fostering deeper understanding and collaboration between the two communities.\nLastly, the Indian Himalayan region, encompassing areas like Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh, Darjeeling, Sikkim, and Arunachal Pradesh, houses over a million Tibetan Buddhists who view the Dalai Lama as their spiritual leader. Local leaders and monastic communities have voiced their support for a traditional reincarnation process. India’s quiet support for Tibetan culture has provided refuge and continuity for the Dalai Lama’s teachings, making these Himalayan communities essential anchors in the spiritual landscape. Together, these stakeholders form a mosaic of belief, politics, and heritage. The reincarnation of the Dalai Lama will be more than a spiritual event—it will be a referendum on the world’s willingness to confront authoritarianism in its most insidious form: the rewriting of sacred tradition to serve political ambition.\nBaishali Sarkar is Research Associate at International Buddhist Confederation.

    "content": "“Realms of the Dharma: Buddhist Art Across Asia” is a large and engaging presentation that includes some of the most splendid sculptures and paintings in the permanent collection of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. It’s great to see these works again. Most of the art was packed up around eight years ago in preparation for the demolition of the museum’s original campus and construction of a new permanent collection building. The current offering of around 180 objects, installed in the temporary exhibition spaces of the Resnick Pavilion, is a version of what was then sent on tour, presented in 2018 at Mexico City’s incomparable National Museum of Anthropology. (LACMA Deputy Director Diana Magaloni was former director there.) Subsequent planned travel to art museums in Texas and the Pacific Northwest were derailed by the COVID-19 pandemic, so the work went back into storage.

Representations of the religious teacher started out as nearly abstract symbols a few thousand years ago — a starburst shape inside a spiraling whorl, for example, which configures an emanation of light within an eternal flow. A Bodhi tree might signal the sacred place where Buddha’s deep insight into enlightenment occurred, or a drawn or carved footprint would be suggestive of following a path. But no biographical texts emerged for several hundred years after his death. Legend and religious doctrine intertwined over centuries, splintering and reconfiguring and taking on new dimensions as they encountered scores of established cultures across South and Southeast Asia and beyond — Daoist philosophy in China, say, or Shinto religion in Japan. Eventually, figurative representations took shape. Needless to say, as they proliferated in what are modern Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Myanmar, Thailand, Indonesia, Cambodia, Korea and more, Buddha took on a variety of forms. LACMA has scores of fine examples, large and small. Sometimes, as in an exquisite 8th century brass and silver cast from Kashmir, just 16 inches tall, he is seated with legs crossed and fingers entwined, counting earthly elements like fire and water being absorbed into the mind. In Tang Dynasty China he sits isolated in regal splendor, like an emperor carved in timeless white stone atop an elegantly draped cushion. In the next room, a sturdy Burmese Buddha wearing a transparent garment of reddish lacquered wood raises an oversize right hand in a jumbo gesture of peace, extending an open left hand that seems caught in mid-motion. (There are scores of symbolic Buddhist hand gestures, called mudras.) A life-size columnar figure carved from sober gray schist, familiar from the Gandhara region of Pakistan, likewise raises a peace mudra, but here the cascading folds of his tunic’s drapery signal a military history of Greco-Roman interactions dating to the expansionist conquests of Alexander the Great. Any religion that’s thousands of years old and practiced in innumerable places will be beyond complicated in doctrine and nuance, and Buddhism is no exception. Deciphering them here is a scholar’s task. The names of individual artists are also mostly lost to us. However, what all these different iterations share stylistically, regardless of whatever embellishments surround the Buddha, is a sense of stable, enduring calm at the core. At all times idealized in his physical features, he’s the living embodiment of the irresistible force paradox — an immovable power and an unstoppable object all at once. Also on view are ritual tools, like a jewel-encrusted crown, ceremonial knives and a lovely offering cabinet adorned with paintings of fierce, glowering demons that caution anyone who might dare to disturb whatever the cupboard holds. Back off! Sculptures and paintings of poets, lamas, deities and especially bodhisattvas — earthly helpers who have postponed their own entry into nirvana, where suffering disappears, in order to help others find their way — are nearly as numerous and varied as Buddha Shakyamuni himself. Some are wildly extravagant, proliferating heads and arms into delirious phantasms of multiple personality and manifold temperaments. An astounding 15th century painting on cotton cloth is a fiery image of sexual coupling between deities, a crimson female figure with both legs wrapped around an ashy blue man. He stands on one straight leg with the other athletically bent, forming a robust stance designed to stabilize an ecstatic act of energetic intercourse. Like fluttering wings, his 12 elegantly splayed arms wield an array of esoteric symbols around her excited body, while her single arm raises what appears to be a ritual blade high overhead. His flaming-eyed face is frontal, hers is overlaid in perfect profile. The shrewd composition abuts their lips, so that they are just about to touch in a kiss. Chakrasamvara, the blue-man emblem of compassion, is being embraced by his consort, Vajravarahi, bright red symbol of wisdom, in a spectacularly explosive display whose arrested design seems intended as a spur to deep meditation. They are on the brink, and so, it is to be hoped, are we. The installation of “Realms of the Dharma” is pretty straightforward. The first section introduces Siddhartha Gautama. A few wall texts outline basic Buddhist principles and the religion’s two major forms — Theravada (or monastic) and Mahayana (sort of “Buddhism for all”). From there, most objects are clustered by simple chronology and the region where they were made. That organizational scheme for such varied works of art is standard for permanent museum collections. It’s rather unusual at LACMA, though, given the timing. Earlier this month, previews were held of the empty new building for the permanent collection, the David Geffen Galleries, explicitly designed to replace chronology and geography with art clustered by theme. Press materials for “Dharma” suggest it’s a thematic package, with the exhibition as a means to learn about Buddhism. That reduces art to illustration, but happily the installation doesn’t come across that way. Art museums are great places to learn about art — about how it’s made, by whom and why — but not so great for religious education. “Realms of the Dharma: Buddhist Art Across Asia” and its handsome scholarly catalog, written by LACMA curator Stephen Little and former associate curator Tushara Bindu Gude, are good at that. But would an American art museum ever do a show on the theme of, say, “Transubstantiation: Catholic Art Across Europe and the United States,” in order to teach the diverse subtleties and dynastic refinements of a belief in the conversion of bread and wine into flesh and blood? Probably not. Aside from trying to wedge such wildly disparate Catholic artists as Fra Bartolomeo, Paul Cézanne, Tsuguharu Foujita and Andy Warhol into a single coherent exhibition, reducing art to illustration just undermines it. The temptation to frame Buddhist art that way is surely a function of the religion’s unfamiliarity, its \"exoticism,\" except in shallow pop culture terms. Of the roughly half-billion Buddhists worldwide, less than 1% of Americans identify with it. According to a fascinating March study from the Pew Research Center, Buddhism is today second only to Christianity in experiencing especially large losses in adherents globally, with former followers switching to other faiths or, more often, now expressing no religious affiliation at all. The majority live in California, a primary entry point for Asian immigration to the United States, but barely 100,000 Buddhists are estimated to practice in Los Angeles. Also useful for museum audiences for a permanent collection show would be some acknowledgment of complex issues around the history of this sacred art’s ownership. More than one LACMA work has been contested as stolen, including an impressive 15th century painting from Nepal of an important Buddhist spiritual master named Vanaratna. LACMA bought the painting in 1977, when collecting standards were very different than they are now. The wall label, without making a definitive declaration, would be an ideal place to introduce the important subject of case-by-case provenance research, but the subject is ignored. “Realms of the Dharma” will remain on view for a year, closing in July 2026. That means LACMA’s Buddhist masterworks won’t be in the Geffen building when it debuts in April next year, or anytime soon after that. (Architect Peter Zumthor is testing paint glazes for some of the Geffen’s all-concrete walls, although a final decision on whether to add color has not been made.) The show is sensitively installed in Resnick. Given the art’s nearly decade-long hiatus from L.A., it’s worth visiting more than once during the next several months, before it disappears again.",

    "title": "Trump’s funding cut stalls water projects, risks for millions",
    "content": "The Trump administration’s decision to slash nearly all US foreign aid has left dozens of water and sanitation projects half-finished across the globe, creating new hazards for some of the people they were designed to benefit, Reuters has found.\n\nReuters has identified 21 unfinished projects in 16 countries after speaking to 17 sources familiar with the infrastructure plans. Most of these projects have not previously been reported.\n\nWith hundreds of millions of dollars in funding cancelled since January, workers have put down their shovels and left holes half dug and building supplies unguarded, according to interviews with US and local officials and internal documents seen by Reuters.\n\nAs a result, millions of people who were promised clean drinking water and reliable sanitation facilities by the United States have been left to fend for themselves.\n\nWater towers intended to serve schools and health clinics in Mali have been abandoned, according to two U.S. officials who spoke on condition of anonymity. In Nepal, construction was halted on more than 100 drinking water systems, leaving plumbing supplies and 6 500 bags of cement in local communities. The Himalayan nation will use its own funds to finish the job, according to the country’s water minister Pradeep Yadav.\n\nIn Lebanon, a project to provide cheap solar power to water utilities was scrapped, costing some 70 people their jobs and halting plans to improve regional services. The utilities are now relying on diesel and other sources to power their services, said Suzy Hoayek, an adviser to Lebanon’s energy ministry.\n\nIn Kenya, residents of Taita Taveta County say they are now more vulnerable to flooding than they had been before, as half-finished irrigation canals could collapse and sweep away crops. Community leaders say it will cost $2,000 to lower the risk – twice the average annual income in the area.\n\n“I have no protection from the flooding that the canal will now cause, the floods will definitely get worse,” said farmer Mary Kibachia, 74.\n\nBIPARTISAN SUPPORT\n\nTrump’s dismantling of the US Agency for International Development has left life-saving food and medical aid rotting in warehouses and thrown humanitarian efforts around the world into turmoil. The cuts may cause an additional 14 million deaths by 2030, according to research published in The Lancet medical journal.\n\nThe Trump administration and its supporters argue that the United States should spend its money to benefit Americans at home rather than sending it abroad, and say USAID had strayed from its original mission by funding projects like LGBT rights in Serbia.\n\nWith an annual budget of $450 million, the US water projects accounted for a small fraction of the $61 billion in foreign aid distributed by the United States last year.\n\nBefore Trump’s reelection in November, the water projects had not been controversial in Washington. A 2014 law that doubled funding passed both chambers of Congress unanimously.\n\nAdvocates say the United States has over the years improved the lives of tens of millions of people by building pumps, irrigation canals, toilets and other water and sanitation projects. That means children are less likely to die of water-borne diseases like diarrhea, girls are more likely to stay in school, and young men are less likely to be recruited by extremist groups, said John Oldfield, a consultant and lobbyist for water infrastructure projects.\n\n“Do we want girls carrying water on their heads for their families? Or do you want them carrying school books?” he said.\n\nThe US State Department, which has taken over foreign aid from USAID, did not respond to a request for comment about the impact of halting the water projects.\n\nThe agency has restored some funding for life-saving projects, but Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said American assistance will be more limited going forward.\n\nAt least one water project has been restarted. Funding for a $6 billion desalination plant in Jordan was restored after a diplomatic push by King Abdullah.\n\nBut funding has not resumed for projects in other countries including Ethiopia, Tanzania, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, say people familiar with those programs who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nThat means women in those areas will have to walk for hours to collect unsafe water, children will face increased disease risk and health facilities will be shuttered, said Tjada D’Oyen McKenna, CEO of Mercy Corps, a nonprofit that worked with USAID on water projects in Congo, Nigeria and Afghanistan that were intended to benefit 1.7 million people.\n\n“This isn’t just the loss of aid — it’s the unraveling of progress, stability, and human dignity,” she said.\n\nTHE PERILS OF FETCHING WATER\n\nIn eastern Congo, where fighting between Congolese forces and M23 rebels has claimed thousands of lives, defunct USAID water kiosks now serve as play areas for children.\n\nEvelyne Mbaswa, 38, told Reuters her 16-year-old son went to fetch water in June and never came home – a familiar reality to families in the violence-wracked region.\n\n“When we send young girls, they are raped, young boys are kidnapped…. All this is because of the lack of water,” the mother of nine said.\n\nA spokesperson for the Congolese government did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn Kenya, USAID was in the midst of a five-year, $100 million project that aimed to provide drinking water and irrigation systems for 150 000 people when contractors and staffers were told in January to stop their work, according to internal documents seen by Reuters. Only 15% of the work had been completed at that point, according to a May 15 memo by DAI Global LLC, the contractor on the project.\n\nThat has left open trenches and deep holes that pose acute risks for children and livestock and left $100,000 worth of pipes, fencing and other materials exposed at construction sites, where they could degrade or be looted, according to other correspondence seen by Reuters. USAID signage at those sites makes clear who is responsible for the half-finished work, several memos say.\n\nThat could hurt the United States’ reputation and potentially give a boost to extremist groups seeking fresh recruits in the region, according to a draft memo from the U.S. embassy in Nairobi to the State Department seen by Reuters.\n\nThe al Qaeda-linked al Shabaab group based in Somalia has been responsible for a string of high-profile attacks in Kenya, including an assault on a university in 2015 that killed at least 147 people.\n\n“The reputational risk of not finishing these projects could turn into a security risk,” the memo said.\n\nDAMAGING FLOODS\n\nIn Kenya’s Taita Taveta, a largely rural county that has endured cyclical drought and flooding, workers had only managed to build brick walls along 220 metres of the 3.1-kilometre (1.9 mile) irrigation canal when they were ordered to stop, community leaders said. And those walls have not been plastered, leaving them vulnerable to erosion.\n\n“Without plaster, the walls will collapse in heavy rain, and the flow of water will lead to the destruction of farms,” said Juma Kubo, a community leader.\n\nThe community has asked the Kenyan government and international donors to help finish the job, at a projected cost of 68 million shillings ($526,000).\n\nIn the meantime, they plan to sell the cement and steel cables left on site, Kubo said, to raise money to plaster and backfill the canal.\n\nThe county government needs to find “funds to at least finish the project to the degree we can with the materials we have, if not complete it fully,” said Stephen Kiteto Mwagoti, an irrigation officer working for the county.\n\nThe Kenyan government did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nFor Kibachia, who has lived with flooding for years, help cannot come soon enough.\n\nThree months after work stopped on the project, her mud hut was flooded with thigh-deep water.\n\n“It was really bad this time. I had to use soil to level the floor of my house and to patch up holes in the wall because of damage caused by the floods,” she said.\n\n“Where can I go? This is home.”",

    "title": "'Intruders Not Welcome' -- Over 100 Anti-Mass Migration Protests Held Across Poland",
    "content": "Thousands of Poles took to the streets on Saturday as over a hundred “Stop Immigration!” demonstrations were staged in 80 towns and cities across the country.\n\nOrganised by the populist-nationalist Confederation Liberty and Independence (Konfederacja) political alliance, 110 protests were held in opposition to the open borders agenda favoured by Brussels, the neoliberal government of Prime Minister Donald Tusk in Warsaw, and to warn against Poland falling victim to the same fate as fellow European nations such as France and Germany from mass migration.\n\nSpeaking in the Polish capital, Confederation MP Krzysztof Bosak said per Fakt: “Without Poland closing to illegal immigration, without starting a deportation operation, without renouncing political correctness, without equipping the Border Guard and the forces responsible for controlling the legality of stay and without labour market control, security will gradually deteriorate. This policy must change.”\n\n“Enough of the years-long policy of ‘let everyone in, and who they are will be determined later,'” he added on X. “Polish women and men have the right to be concerned about the level of security in their own homeland.”\n\nBosak warned that illegal migrants attempting to break into the country were becoming more aggressive towards Polish soldiers guarding the nation’s borders, and therefore called for the complete closure of the borders with Belarus, Lithuania, Slovakia, and Ukraine. The Confederation MP also demanded that Polish soldiers be empowered to use lethal force against illegals attempting to break through the borders.\n\nBefore the outset of many of the demonstrations on Saturday, participants held a moment of silence to honour Klaudia K., a 24-year-old Polish woman who was murdered in June by a 19-year-old Venezuelan migrant, PAP reports.\n\nAt one of the larger gatherings in the southwestern city of Katowice, fans of rival soccer clubs put aside their differences to stand side by side in opposition to migration, demonstrating the depth of feeling over the issue.\n\nAt a rally in Kielce, Dawid Lewicki, leader of the Świętokrzyskie Confederation, said: “We see what is happening in Western European countries that have massively accepted immigrants and now cannot cope with the threats these people bring. I am referring to the various types of crimes they commit on a massive scale.\n\n“We do not want our country to be forced to face such a challenge as well. We do not want any Polish city to become the European capital of rape, like Stockholm, or for situations to arise like those on the streets of London or Paris, where people cannot feel safe. We firmly say no to accepting immigrants in Poland.”\n\nWhile Poland has long held a reputation for being strict on immigration compared to its neighbours, with the country escaping the worst of the 2015 Europe Migrant Crisis sparked by then-German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the country has seen a large influx of foreigners in recent years.\n\nAlthough much of this was a result of a flood of refugees fleeing the Russian war in neighbouring Ukraine, the liberal-globalist government of Prime Minister Tusk has increasingly allowed in more economic migrants, issuing over 322,000 work permits last year. Migrants from the Philippines, Colombia, India, Nepal, Uzbekistan, and Bangladesh topped the list of the most common nationalities to receive a work permit in Poland last year.\n\nEarlier this month, the Polish government deployed the military to enact border controls at dozens of crossings with Germany and Lithuania. Meanwhile, there has been a reported uptick in the number of Polish citizens acting as vigilante border guards amid claims that the recently installed government of Friedrich Merz in Berlin has been pushing illegals towards Poland.\n\nOn Friday, Poland joined a group of six nations in the Bavarian Alps to demand that the European Union enact stricter requirements for asylum seekers, step up deportations, and strengthen controls along the external borders.\n\nFollow Kurt Zindulka on X: Follow @KurtZindulka or e-mail to: kzindulka@breitbart.com",

    "title": "Special Intensive Revision: Preparation Over SIR in West Bengal to Start by First Week of August, Say Sources",
    "content": "Kolkata, July 19: With the detailed preparations already completed, the work for the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of the voters' list in West Bengal by the Election Commission of India (ECI) is expected to start anytime from now, officials said on Saturday. Sources from the West Bengal Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) said that in all probability, the work for SIR might start earliest in the last week of July or latest by the first week of August. The last time the SIR of the voters' list in West Bengal was done was in January 2002, during the previous Left Front regime, and so this fresh SIR will be conducted after a gap of 23 years. The SIR is significant for West Bengal since the state will be going for crucial Assembly polls next year, which in all probability will be in May 2026. A door-to-door survey of the voter's list will be carried out as part of the SIR process. The commission also retains the right to file an FIR against any individual accused of getting a fake voters' card. The Trinamool Congress had already objected to this SIR since it was started in Bihar, which is going for polls later this year. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said that the SIR was started in Bihar but is targeting West Bengal. Bihar Special Intensive Revision Exercise: 95.92% Electors Covered; 6 More Days Still Left, Says Election Commission of India. She also claimed that the real intention behind starting the SIR was to impose the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in West Bengal. However, the state unit of the BJP had wholeheartedly welcomed the SIR. The West Bengal Leader of the Opposition (LoP) and BJP leader, Suvendu Adhikari, earlier this week, stressed the need for a door-to-door review to identify the illegal Rohingya infiltrators who have managed to get their names enrolled in the voters' list of the state with the help of the state administration and the ruling Trinamool Congress. \"In the special intensive review conducted by the Election Commission of India in Bihar, which is going for polls this year, a few lakhs of illegal Rohingya infiltrators have been identified. Similarly, several illegal Rohingya infiltrators have entered West Bengal after illegally crossing the state's borders with Nepal and Bangladesh. There is a need for an urgent door-to-door review to identify these Rohingya voters,\" Adhikari said. However, Chief Minister Banerjee refuted the allegations of LoP Adhikari and said that a fake propaganda of illegal Rohingya infiltration ion the state is being carried out to strike out the names of genuine voters in the state from the voters' list.

    "title": "Trump's funding cut stalls water projects, increasing risks for millions",
    "content": "ReutersA woman arranges jerrycans as people queue at the standpipe, where incomplete water connections caused by USAID funding cuts to the NGO Mercy Corps have led to ongoing water shortages, in Goma, North Kivu province, Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nThe Trump administration's decision to slash nearly all U.S. foreign aid has left dozens of water and sanitation projects half-finished across the globe, creating new hazards for some of the people they were designed to benefit, Reuters has found. Reuters has identified 21 unfinished projects in 16 countries after speaking to 17 sources familiar with the infrastructure plans. Most of these projects have not previously been reported. With hundreds of millions of dollars in funding cancelled since January, workers have put down their shovels and left holes half dug and building supplies unguarded, according to interviews with U.S. and local officials and internal documents seen by Reuters. As a result, millions of people who were promised clean drinking water and reliable sanitation facilities by the United States have been left to fend for themselves. Water towers intended to serve schools and health clinics in Mali have been abandoned, according to two U.S. officials who spoke on condition of anonymity. In Nepal, construction was halted on more than 100 drinking water systems, leaving plumbing supplies and 6,500 bags of cement in local communities. The Himalayan nation will use its own funds to finish the job, according to the country's water minister Pradeep Yadav. In Lebanon, a project to provide cheap solar power to water utilities was scrapped, costing some 70 people their jobs and halting plans to improve regional services. The utilities are now relying on diesel and other sources to power their services, said Suzy Hoayek, an adviser to Lebanon's energy ministry. In Kenya, residents of Taita Taveta County say they are now more vulnerable to flooding than they had been before, as half-finished irrigation canals could collapse and sweep away crops. Community leaders say it will cost $2,000 to lower the risk - twice the average annual income in the area. \"I have no protection from the flooding that the canal will now cause, the floods will definitely get worse,\" said farmer Mary Kibachia, 74. BIPARTISAN SUPPORTLive Events Trump's dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development has left life-saving food and medical aid rotting in warehouses and thrown humanitarian efforts around the world into turmoil. The cuts may cause an additional 14 million deaths by 2030, according to research published in The Lancet medical journal. The Trump administration and its supporters argue that the United States should spend its money to benefit Americans at home rather than sending it abroad, and say USAID had strayed from its original mission by funding projects like LGBT rights in Serbia. With an annual budget of $450 million, the U.S. water projects accounted for a small fraction of the $61 billion in foreign aid distributed by the United States last year. Before Trump's reelection in November, the water projects had not been controversial in Washington. A 2014 law that doubled funding passed both chambers of Congress unanimously. Advocates say the United States has over the years improved the lives of tens of millions of people by building pumps, irrigation canals, toilets and other water and sanitation projects. That means children are less likely to die of water-borne diseases like diarrhea, girls are more likely to stay in school, and young men are less likely to be recruited by extremist groups, said John Oldfield, a consultant and lobbyist for water infrastructure projects. \"Do we want girls carrying water on their heads for their families? Or do you want them carrying school books?\" he said. The U.S. State Department, which has taken over foreign aid from USAID, did not respond to a request for comment about the impact of halting the water projects. The agency has restored some funding for life-saving projects, but Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said American assistance will be more limited going forward. At least one water project has been restarted. Funding for a $6 billion desalination plant in Jordan was restored after a diplomatic push by King Abdullah. But funding has not resumed for projects in other countries including Ethiopia, Tanzania, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, say people familiar with those programs who spoke on condition of anonymity. That means women in those areas will have to walk for hours to collect unsafe water, children will face increased disease risk and health facilities will be shuttered, said Tjada D'Oyen McKenna, CEO of Mercy Corps, a nonprofit that worked with USAID on water projects in Congo, Nigeria and Afghanistan that were intended to benefit 1.7 million people. \"This isn't just the loss of aid - it's the unraveling of progress, stability, and human dignity,\" she said. THE PERILS OF FETCHING WATER In eastern Congo, where fighting between Congolese forces and M23 rebels has claimed thousands of lives, defunct USAID water kiosks now serve as play areas for children. Evelyne Mbaswa, 38, told Reuters her 16-year-old son went to fetch water in June and never came home - a familiar reality to families in the violence-wracked region. \"When we send young girls, they are raped, young boys are kidnapped.... All this is because of the lack of water,\" the mother of nine said. A spokesperson for the Congolese government did not respond to requests for comment. In Kenya, USAID was in the midst of a five-year, $100 million project that aimed to provide drinking water and irrigation systems for 150,000 people when contractors and staffers were told in January to stop their work, according to internal documents seen by Reuters. Only 15% of the work had been completed at that point, according to a May 15 memo by DAI Global LLC, the contractor on the project. That has left open trenches and deep holes that pose acute risks for children and livestock and left $100,000 worth of pipes, fencing and other materials exposed at construction sites, where they could degrade or be looted, according to other correspondence seen by Reuters. USAID signage at those sites makes clear who is responsible for the half-finished work, several memos say. That could hurt the United States' reputation and potentially give a boost to extremist groups seeking fresh recruits in the region, according to a draft memo from the U.S. embassy in Nairobi to the State Department seen by Reuters. The al Qaeda-linked al Shabaab group based in Somalia has been responsible for a string of high-profile attacks in Kenya, including an assault on a university in 2015 that killed at least 147 people. \"The reputational risk of not finishing these projects could turn into a security risk,\" the memo said. DAMAGING FLOODS In Kenya's Taita Taveta, a largely rural county that has endured cyclical drought and flooding, workers had only managed to build brick walls along 220 metres of the 3.1-kilometre (1.9 mile) irrigation canal when they were ordered to stop, community leaders said. And those walls have not been plastered, leaving them vulnerable to erosion. \"Without plaster, the walls will collapse in heavy rain, and the flow of water will lead to the destruction of farms,\" said Juma Kobo, a community leader. The community has asked the Kenyan government and international donors to help finish the job, at a projected cost of 68 million shillings ($526,000). In the meantime, they plan to sell the cement and steel cables left on site, Kobo said, to raise money to plaster and backfill the canal. The county government needs to find \"funds to at least finish the project to the degree we can with the materials we have, if not complete it fully,\" said Stephen Kiteto Mwagoti, an irrigation officer working for the county. The Kenyan government did not respond to a request for comment. For Kibachia, who has lived with flooding for years, help cannot come soon enough. Three months after work stopped on the project, her mud hut was flooded with thigh-deep water. \"It was really bad this time. I had to use soil to level the floor of my house and to patch up holes in the wall because of damage caused by the floods,\" she said. \"Where can I go? This is home.\"(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News ontrumpusaidstate departmenttavetawater and sanitation projectsdemocratic republic of congo\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

    "title": "Tibet in translation: how the capital city of Lhasa has been reshaped, and rewritten",
    "content": "The changes in Tibet’s Lhasa are perhaps most evident in the heart of the old city, Barkhor Square, where the revered Jokhang Temple stands. Built in 639 CE by the “first king of unified Tibet”, Songtsen Gampo, the deities of the Buddha were brought by his two wives, Tang Dynasty’s Princess Wencheng and Princess Bhrikuti from Nepal.\n\nBuilt around this temple, where Buddhists would do a daily parikrama, was a bustling market. In 2007, it was packed with stalls selling jewellery, handicrafts, wooden bowls, prayer flags, incense and food. Today, Barkhor stands as an empty piazza, with shops at the far ends of the square.\n\nDecades-long transformation\n\nIn 2012, as part of a drive to give Lhasa a facelift, the stalls were cleared, and street vendors moved from outside the Jokhang temple, and along the main Youthok Lam (street) that leads to the Potala Palace. The signage is now almost entirely in Chinese, and the shopkeepers belong to China’s Han ethnic majority unlike in the past, when they were mostly Tibetan.\n\nMany of those moved out are now housed in a multi-story concrete mall, Tibet Market. On the ground floor, the main corridor has more Han shopkeepers, with Tibetans relegated to the lines behind or floors above. Inside the Jokhang Temple, and at the opera, Princess Wencheng, which has been performed in Lhasa and other parts of the Tibetan Autonomous Region (TAR) for more than a decade, the Chinese queen, and link to Buddhism are played up over the ties to Nepal and India. This summer, Lhasa hosted another opera — a combination of a local epic, King Gesar, with the Confucian Shi Jing (Book of Poems).\n\nThe three most visible changes at Barkhor Square — infrastructural, demographic and cultural — represent the transformation of Tibet over the past few decades. As a member of three Indian journalist delegations invited to Lhasa by the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, I have witnessed these changes during visits in 2007, 2014 and June 2025.\n\nInfrastructural changes\n\nAfter annexing Tibet in 1950, most of the Chinese government’s planning focused on security, especially concerning Tibetan Buddhism and monks. During the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976), Jokhang Temple was closed for worship. But, by the turn of the century, there was a shift towards controlling the region through a blitzkrieg of investment. China’s 10th Five-Year Plan (2001-2005), cleared by the National People’s Congress, allocated over $4 billion for infrastructure development in Tibet, which rose to $21 billion in the 11th Five-Year Plan (2006-10), for developing expressways, a high-speed rail project, and more than 300 key projects.\n\nThe launch of the Beijing-Lhasa train in 2006, which defied the steep climb to the Qinghai plateau, was hailed as an engineering marvel but speeded the influx of mainland Chinese to the region. The drive from the airport to Lhasa city, which once took almost three hours, now takes just 45 minutes due to tunnels bored through the mountains, and solar panels everywhere indicate a renewable energy transition. Experts and Tibetan activists say that the rapid construction of roads, tunnels, airports, and concrete cities like New Lhasa, across the Kyichu (Lhasa River) from Old Lhasa, has caused environmental damage, speeded global warming, and melted glaciers in a land that cradles the world’s highest mountains and is the source of many of Asia’s rivers. According to our tour-guides, rising temperatures in Lhasa and disappearing snow, even over Mount Kailash, are palpable.\n\nThe construction, mining and malls mandated by the Chinese government’s development plans have brought many workers and mainland Chinese seeking jobs. We meet many in the shopping areas as well as the government offices we visit. From 2010 to 2020, the population of Tibet (or Xizang, as the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC) mandated the region’s six prefectures be called in official documents) grew from about 2.7 million to 3.1 million. But the percentage of Tibetans or ethnic minorities dropped from nearly 90% to 86%, indicating a demographic change.\n\nLinguistic politics\n\nThe language in Lhasa has shifted — Mandarin Chinese (Putonghua) is taught in schools to inculcate “national unification and strengthen ethnic unity” through a “modern education” according to a 2023 CPC paper. All official documents and signage now use the Chinese name ‘Xizang’ and not Tibet.\n\nAt Lhasa’s School Number 8 — where many international delegations are brought — the main language of instruction appears to be Mandarin, though we were taken to a class where students were chanting in Tibetan, and another where a scholar was practising the Tibetan script. This is a sensitive subject for the Chinese government, amid UN Special Rapporteurs’ criticism that about 1 million Tibetan children had been “separated from families” and pushed into schools that sought to “assimilate Tibetans into majority Han culture”. While the CPC paper details measures to continue the study of Tibetan Buddhism “adapted to China’s reality”, it also lists cultural changes that are more obvious to the eye in Lhasa. \n\nRelocation projects for poorer and rural Tibetans resemble Beijing hutongs (alleyways lined with houses) rather than smaller, colourful Tibetan homes seen in the countryside. There, we meet Tibetan families in a room where photographs of Chinese President Xi Jinping and Chairman Mao are prominently displayed. Security forces, that we saw regularly in 2007, patrolling Lhasa streets with riot control gear and cattle-prongs to deal with self-immolation protests, are less visible. In busy areas, we see high-tech police surveillance vans, however.\n\nThe disappearance of links to India, a regular travel destination for Tibetans now more restricted by a heavily controlled Nepal-Tibet border, is evident. In 2007, stalls at Barkhor sold Bollywood DVDs, shops stocked Indian products, and monks at Jokhang and the Potala Palace spoke to us in Hindi. Two decades later, very few speak, or admit to speaking, Hindi at all.\n\nErasing the Dalai Lama\n\nThe biggest change centres on erasing any reference to the 14th Dalai Lama, now 90 years old. He escaped from Lhasa 65 years ago, but his influence remains a concern for the Chinese government. All photographs of him are banned, and worshipping him is illegal. However, in 2007, I met Tibetans who, recognising me as an Indian, asked about him and showed photos concealed in their jackets, or behind shop counters.\n\nIn 2014, during a brief period of openness following Chinese government talks with Dalai Lama representatives, we visited his summer home in Norbulingka, where Tibetans thronged to offer khadas (silk scarves) to his belongings — furniture, a radio set, even a towel rack.\n\nThis time, we are told Norbulingka is closed. I ask a young man in Barkhor if he is following the Dalai Lama’s birthday celebrations in Dharamshala. “Yes,” he says, pointing to his chest as he looks around furtively, and adds, “but only inside my heart.”\n\nsuhasini.h@thehindu.co.in",

    "title": "Monsoon menace",
    "content": "MONSOONS are a recurring feature and come as no surprise. And yet, astonishingly, the most predictable health threats associated with the season are routinely neglected.\n\nThe most common monsoon health hazards include: acute watery diarrhoea and cholera, especially in Sindh and southern Punjab, where flooding contaminates drinking water; dengue and malaria outbreaks, common in urban lowlands like Karachi, Lahore and Peshawar due to standing water and poor drainage; skin infections, scabies and leptospirosis in displaced populations; maternal and child health crises, particularly in hard-to-reach flood-affected areas where routine services collapse.\n\nThe Met Department issues repeated advisories about monsoons and its intensity, but response prioritisation at the national level remains inconsistent. In theory, the NDMA coordinates with the Ministry of National Health Services and provincial health departments to preposition stockpiles (for example, cholera and antimalarial kits).\n\nIn practice, response remains post-disaster, not anticipatory. Some glaring examples can be traced back to the 2022 floods. Response teams arrived after major outbreaks had begun and did not anticipate preventive action. The National Institute of Health (NIH) maintains an Emerg-ency Operations Centre and disease surveillance unit, but real-time district-level health risk analysis is rarely available to front-line responders in advance. There’s no standardised health risk heat map integrated into the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) monsoon preparedness plans, and health supplies are rarely pre-deployed based on forecasted risk.\n\nIn Pakistan, trigger-based health action is limited to “simplified early action protocols” by the Pakistan Red Crescent Society for floods (for example, in the Kabul River basin) focused on WASH and cash; no health kit pre-deployments have been activated as yet. By contrast, Bangla-desh established early action protocols across sectors, including health, WASH and cash triggered by riverine flooding forecasts, and Nepal has been piloting anticipatory health responses in recent years, mainly around floods and food security. Where finance-based forecasting is concerned, Pakistan mainly uses pilots through PRC plus the International Federation of Red Cross for heatwaves, droughts and floods that remain small in scale, whereas Bangladesh has institutionalised FbF at the national level with pre-approved finance and scenario-based triggers. In Nepal, active plots are embedded in DRR strategies, often tied into food security anticipatory schemes. Integration into local health programmes is weak in Pakistan, with ad hoc coordination between PDMA and the health department. Nepal has integrated community clinics into a pre-activation mechanism viz the FbF task force.\n\nThe government buy-in for anticipatory health remains siloed. The monsoon contingency is led by NDMA and not integrated into health planning. Bangladesh launched an early action protocol in 2019 under its disaster management & relief ministry that targets multiple sectors, including health, and Nepal is taking steps towards formally including health in DRR and climate planning via federal initiatives and donor programmes.\n\nIn practice, response remains post-disaster, not anticipatory.\n\nWhile Bangladesh has institutionalised anticipatory health action, particularly in cyclone and flood-prone districts, linking it to national health supply chains and forecast-based triggers, Pakistan remains reliant on post-disaster surge capacity, with no formal anticipatory health activation system at the provincial level. Some of the challenges in provincial disaster systems are:\n\nFragmented governance: In most provinces, health and disaster management departments do not share real-time risk or stockpile information. There is no unified logistics platform (for instance, digital inventory dashboards or GIS-based heatmaps) integrating forecasted flood zones with vulnerable health infrastructure.\n\nWeak institutional mandates: PDMA planning documents (like monsoon contingency plans) often mention disease risk in general terms, without assigning clear anticipatory roles to district health officers or logistics focal person.\n\nOperational capacity gaps; For example, in Balochistan and KP, flood-prone areas like Dera Allah Yar or D.I. Khan lack cold-chain storage or mobile health capacity that can be pre-positioned or activated based on risk forecasts.\n\nFinance and procurement lags: Even when forecasts allow for seven-to-10-day early warning, emergency health funding is rarely unlocked in time due to central-level approval bottlenecks and procurement delays.\n\nLack of coordination with non-state actors: INGOs and UN agencies often run parallel anticipatory pilots, but these are not integrated into government SOPs, creating duplication or misalignment in logistics planning.\n\nHowever, despite long-standing structural gaps, there are important signs of progress in aligning health and disaster preparedness in Pakistan. In 2023, the NDMA piloted a joint monsoon simulation exercise with the NIH and provincial stakeholders, marking a first step toward unified early planning; the country’s National Adaptation Plan now explicitly references climate-sensitive disease surveillance and heat-health action plans, signalling a growing awareness of health risks in a changing climate; donor-supported systems such as the WHO and Early Warning Alert and Response Network are slowly improving post-disaster disease tracking and analysis in flood-affected regions.\n\nHowever, progress remains piecemeal and project-based. Without sustained provincial ownership, cross-sector coordination, and dedicated domestic financing, anticipatory health logistics will continue to be the exception not the norm. With rising temperatures, more intense monsoons, and the shifting geography of disease vectors, climate change is no longer a distant threat. It is a health emergency unfolding in real time.\n\nPakistan needs to: formally embed anticipatory health action into disaster risk management protocols; ensure such efforts are resourced through health sector budgets, rather than relying solely on donor-driven projects; build systems that are backed by real time data, integrated early warning and multisector planning.\n\nPakistan needs a ‘Climate and Health Resilience Policy’ that bridges institutions, anticipates climate-driven disease threats, and enables action before and not after the next outbreak.\n\nThe writer is chief executive of the Civil Society Coalition for Climate Change.\n\naisha@csccc.org.pk\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 19th, 2025",

    "title": "How UP Conversion Kingpin Acquired The Name 'Changur Baba', Twisted Followers Around His Fingers",
    "content": "Changur Baba, also known as Jalaluddin, is making headlines everywhere. Many are curious about his name, which he earned because he has six fingers on his left hand. “Changur” is slang for “chae ungli” (six fingers). Born in Rehra Maafi village in Balrampur district, he was originally named Jalaluddin. However, due to his six fingers, people soon started calling him “Changur”. When he styled himself as a Peer, he was quickly named Changur Baba.\nBorn into a poor family, he was shrewd and quick to seize opportunities. He mingled with local politicians and activists, hoping to find luck and make quick money. While selling lockets and trinkets and riding from village to village on a bicycle, he tried to establish himself as a “divine” Peer with supernatural powers. He sensed a political opportunity and dabbled in local politics. He was elected as the Gram Pradhan of Rehra Maafi village and later got his wife elected to the same post. His living conditions improved, and he started travelling to bigger cities, presenting himself as an accomplished Peer. Most of his travels were to Mumbai, as many people from rural Balrampur had migrated to Mumbai and the Gulf region for work.\nA police intelligence source revealed that Changur Baba used to roam around the Haji Ali Dargah in Mumbai and look out for visitors from other religions. It was here that he spotted Neetu Naveen Rohra, who was unable to conceive and visited various temples, shrines, and dargahs. He started giving her lockets and rings with supposed supernatural powers, promising she would soon bear a child, said the officer. Neetu, a well-educated English-speaking woman, was married to Naveen Rohra from a well-to-do Sindhi family in Mumbai. Soon, Neetu conceived and had a daughter, making the couple blind followers of Changur Baba. He started staying in their house during his visits to the city and eventually persuaded them to convert to Islam. The couple and their daughter travelled to Dubai and converted to Islam. Neetu was renamed Nasreen, and Naveen became Jamaluddin.\nChangur Baba has emerged as one of the biggest religious conversion masterminds operating from Balrampur in UP, with connections from Nepal to the Gulf region. He is accused of converting more than 1,500 Hindu girls and a few men to Islam through brainwashing, “love jihad”, force, and blackmail. He allegedly received over Rs 100 crore in funding from abroad and controlled dozens of bank accounts. Police sources say he was part of an international conversion racket backed by Gulf-based organisations. Not only Changur Baba but also his close aides Nasreen (Neetu), Naveen (Jamaluddin), and his son Mehboob received funds from abroad through NRE/NRO accounts. All four are currently under arrest. The passports of Naveen and Nasreen reveal 19 trips to Dubai, and Changur is believed to have travelled even more frequently, sometimes using fake passports. Police sources say preachers from Dubai visited Changur Baba’s mansion in Madhpur, Balrampur, to train his key aides and brainwash victims.\nThough hailing from Rehra Maafi village, Changur created a new base in Madhpur village, Utraula Tehsil of Balrampur district, about 40 kilometres from the Indo-Nepal border. Here, he built a massive 40-room mansion, which served as his main base for conversions and other illegal activities. Authorities found the building illegal and demolished it with eight bulldozers. Police suspect that, apart from the conversion racket, Changur was also involved in anti-national activities and provided a safe house for terrorists at his Madhpur mansion. Gullible girls from Nepal were also potential conversion targets.\nWhile the UP police, ATS, and STF are investigating the case, the central agency ED has also stepped in to probe international connections and money trails. Agencies are also probing his suspected links to Pakistan’s ISI. Investigators found several copies of a book called “Shizer e Tayeeba” at Changur Baba’s Madhpur mansion. This book is not just religious, but acts as a guide on targeting potential converts and brainwashing them. Changur got thousands of copies of this book printed and circulated to his followers in UP, Bihar, West Bengal, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Nepal. He was also planning to print a new book aimed at discrediting the Hindu religion and its alleged malpractices, according to a police source.",

    "title": "World News | Nepal: Splinter Communist Parties from CPN-UML Led by Oli Merge Together as Nation Warms Up for Next General Election",
    "content": "Kathmandu [Nepal], July 18 (ANI): Two splinter communist parties that had parted ways from Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli-led CPN-UML have merged together as the Himalayan Nation warms up for the next general election due in 2027. The CPN- Unified Socialist, led by Madhav Kumar Nepal, and the CPN Unity National Campaign, led by Bamdev Gautam, announced their merger on Friday at a ceremony held at City Hall in Kathmandu. With the merger, Bamdev Gautam, the campaign coordinator, has formally joined the CPN-Unified Socialist, which was formed after a split with CPN-Unified Marxist Leninist led by KP Sharma Oli following the intra-party rift.\nAlso Read | 'There Should Be No Double Standards on Energy Trade': India Rejects EU's 18th Sanctions Package on Russia, Reaffirms Commitment to Energy Security.\nAccording to the merger agreement, Gautam, a former Home Minister, has been appointed to the third most senior position in the Unified Socialist Party, following party chair Madhav Kumar Nepal and senior leader Jhalanath Khanal. The leaders announced that they had decided to unite following a consensus on political ideology, principles, programs, strategies, and direction. The leaders said that the unification aims to strengthen Nepal's communist movement through broader left unity.\nAlso Read | US Designates Lashkar Proxy TRF As 'Foreign Terrorist Organisation': A Glance at How Terror Outfit Operates With Pakistan Army.\n\"Today, we are giving a fresh start to the unity campaign. The unity campaign hasn't ended, this is just the process to start the unification, and this will continue,\" Madhav Kumar Nepal, Chairman of the CPN-Unified Socialist, said, addressing the event. The Unified Socialist and the group led by Gautam had split from the CPN-UML in 2021 and had been operating separately since. Over the past four years, both sides engaged in formal and informal negotiations towards party reunification.\nLeaders on both sides said that the merger represents a significant milestone in building a united front for Nepal's leftist forces and in countering political fragmentation within the communist bloc.\n\"Unity really is enthralling and sweet. This unification is the result of the desire that all the communists in Nepal had wanted. Cadres and party members had wanted this unification and want a united party, unfortunately because of some leaders in the forefront of the communist movement the party had to be torn off and remains divided,\" Jhalanath Khanal, former Prime Minister and second-in-line leader of the CPN-Unified Socialist said addressing the gathering jibbing on incumbent Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, also the chair of CPN-UML.\nIn 2021, after breaking off from CPN-UML, both the former Prime Minister's duo, Madhav Kumar Nepal and Jhalanath Khanal, had formed the CPN (Unified Socialist), but Gautam chose not to join the new party. Gautam, at the time, launched his own CPN Unity National Campaign, announcing that he would work to bring all communist forces under a single umbrella by not joining any side, including the CPN-UML, the US, or the Maoist Centre. Although multiple rounds of talks were initiated, an agreement ultimately didn't materialise.\n\"We should have a unified communist party, that's why we should unify all those splinter communist groups. The unification between the CPN-Unified Marxist Leninist (UML) and the CPN-Maoist Centre, led by KP Sharma Oli, was never on the opposite side. It was Madhav (Kumar Nepal) and I who were ready for it, and we also could bring him to the table of agreement at the end, and the party was unified,\" Gautam recalled on Friday again, stressing unification.\nFailing to convince other parties of the need for unification, Gautam has eventually chosen to merge his faction into the Unified Socialist, which holds 10 seats in the House of Representatives and eight in the National Assembly. With Gautam on board, the CPN-Unified Socialist now has 9 seats in the upper house.\nThe merger between the two splinter parties at this juncture coincides with the approaching periodic general elections, expected in 2027. With political parties already starting to talk and make preparations for the expected general election, the merger between the communist factions is expected to peak in the coming days.\nAlthough the leaders expressed their interest and willingness to merge all the communist factions into one, Madhav Kumar Nepal, the chairman of the CPN-Unified Socialist, ruled out any possibility of merger with the CPN-UML led by Oli. Out on bail in the Patanjali land scam, the former Prime Minister announced, \"If we are searching for the possibility of unification with the CPN- Unified Marxist Leninist (UML), then there is no chance of unification. Standing at this point in time, there is no possibility of unification with the CPN-UML. We have seen the situation inside that party. I have no comment on it, if someone has even the slightest expectation over it. But talking about the relation with this party (CPN-Unified Socialist), the statement from the leaders of that party (CPN-UML) is self-explanatory.\" (ANI) (This is an unedited and auto-generated story from Syndicated News feed, LatestLY Staff may not have modified or edited the content body)",

The cybercriminals pretend friendship or tout phony investment opportunities to cheat their targets around the world.\n\nNeth Pheaktra’s statement said Cambodia’s crackdown is ongoing “and will absolutely continue, with a clear mandate from the top leadership to root out all illegal cybercrime activity — regardless of location or affiliation.”\n\nHe said it was strengthened by a directive issued Monday by Prime Minister Hun Manet that threatened state personnel at all levels with transfers or dismissal if they failed to act vigorously against cyberscams.\n\nThe latest arrests followed 2,418 others in the first six months of the year involving 18 alleged scam operations in different parts of the country, said a report from the National Police Commissioner cited by Neth Pheaktra.\n\nThese resulted in 73 prosecutions and 2,322 foreigners being deported, it said.\n\nWorkers at scam centers are often recruited under false pretenses and then held captive to work under tight guard.\n\n“Jobseekers from Asia and beyond are lured by the promise of well-paid work into hellish labour camps run by well-organized gangs, where they are forced to scam under the very real threat of violence,” the human rights groups Amnesty International said in a report issued last month.\n\nIt said the findings of its 18-month investigation into cyberscams “suggest there has been coordination and possibly collusion between Chinese compound bosses and the Cambodian police, who have failed to shut down compounds despite the slew of human rights abuses taking place inside.” The kingpins of many online scam operations tend to be ethnic Chinese organized crime bosses, who generally operate outside China in areas with weak law enforcement.\n\nA spokesperson for the Cambodian human rights organization Licadho, which is often critical of the government, noted the country’s poor reputation due to cybercrime, and welcomed the crackdown.\n\n“This campaign should have been launched long ago because Cambodia has been criticized by international organizations, the international community, and the United Nations for online fraud in Cambodia, which has affected Cambodia’s image, international tourists, investment, security, order, and social security,” Licadko’s operations director Am Sam Ath, told The Associated Press.\n\n“However, launching this campaign is good to demonstrate the Royal Government’s determination and willingness to prevent and suppress online fraud and trust,” he said, noting that other members of the regional Association of Southeast Asian Nations had also acted this year to suppress online crime.",

    "title": "World News | Kathmandu Plane Crash: Probe Blames Saurya Airlines Tragedy on Cargo Shift, Speed Errors and Oversight Lapses",
    "content": "Kathmandu [Nepal], July 18 (ANI): An investigation into the July 24, 2024, Saurya Airlines crash in Nepal's Kathmandu has revealed multiple technical and manual lapses as the primary causes of the tragic incident that claimed 18 lives, leaving only the pilot alive. The Aircraft Accident Investigation Commission (AAIC) released its final report on Friday, citing several critical lapses in weight and balance management, incorrect takeoff speeds, and regulatory oversight failures as key contributing factors to the crash of the Bombardier CRJ-200 aircraft (registration 9N-AME). One of the major findings was that the aircraft's cargo was likely not secured according to guidelines, which may have shifted during takeoff. Also Read | US Designates Lashkar Proxy TRF As 'Foreign Terrorist Organisation': A Glance at How Terror Outfit Operates With Pakistan Army.\nThe AAIC also pointed out that the takeoff speeds (V-speeds) entered and used by the crew did not match official reference speeds from the aircraft's Quick Reference Handbook (QRH), raising the risk of aerodynamic instability as one of the reasons for the fatal crash. The Commission also attributed the pitch rate during takeoff, which reached an abnormal 8.6° per second, nearly triple the aircraft's safe limit of 3°/s, as the third reason contributing to the accident. In addition, the commission also flagged the lack of regulatory oversight in approving the ferry flight without verifying compliance with safety protocols. Also Read | US Shocker: Man Gets Sucked Into MRI Machine in Long Island After He Enters Room Wearing Large Metallic Chain.\nThe Pokhara-bound aircraft, which had been grounded for 34 days prior to the crash and was scheduled for base maintenance in Pokhara, had undergone short-term storage procedures multiple times and had its return-to-service check completed on the morning of the accident. \"While the aircraft had a valid airworthiness certificate, its maintenance records showed time extensions and short-term preparations rather than a long-term, thorough maintenance regime,\" the report states. The pilot-in-command had over 6,000 hours of total flight time and nearly 5,000 on the CRJ-200, with valid licenses and recent rest. The first officer was less experienced, with around 1,800 total flight hours. There was also a supernumerary (S/N) engineer on board. Despite the apparent fitness of the crew and aircraft, crucial oversights in weight documentation, speed settings, and preflight planning may have compromised the safety of the flight. The ill-fated aircraft, bound for Pokhara, was carrying 19 individuals and 600 kg of baggage. The total takeoff weight was 18,132 kg, and the centre of gravity (CG) was at 20 per cent of the MAC (Mean Aerodynamic Chord) with a stabiliser trim set to 6. The report also has highlighted that the cargo loading protocols are insufficient. Investigators found that cargo and baggage may not have been properly secured with straps or nets, as required by the airline's own Ground Handling Manual. Shifting loads during takeoff can significantly impact balance and control, especially in a rear-heavy configuration. \"The incorrect stabiliser setting or unbalanced CG may have contributed to the rapid pitch-up, causing a stall or loss of control,\" the report states. The AAIC also identified non-compliance with standard loading procedures as a key safety violation, emphasising that such oversights are unacceptable even in ferry or non-revenue flights. Along with the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN), the oversight body of the aviation regulatory body of the Himalayan nation lacks oversight.\nSaurya Airlines obtained ferry flight approval for this non-revenue flight from Kathmandu to Pokhara. However, investigators found that the flight permission process was inadequately followed.\n\"The required documentation, including full compliance with CAAN's 2015 Flight Permission Manual, was incomplete or missing. This regulatory lapse enabled a flight to proceed without proper checks on critical safety elements like load distribution and updated speed charts,\" it states.\nIn its report, the AAIC has recommended that CAAN (Civil Aviation Authority) urgently review and revise procedures for ferry and non-scheduled flights to ensure such incidents do not recur. The Flight Data Recorder (FDR) and Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) were successfully recovered and analysed in Singapore, with oversight from Nepal's AAIC and international observers from Canada, the USA, and the FAA.\n\"The data showed that the aircraft's engines functioned normally during the event. However, a dangerously high pitch rate, peaking at 8.6° per second, was recorded during rotation, far exceeding safe limits,\" the AAIC report states.\n\"The CVR recorded multiple stick shaker activations, indicating stall warnings. The aircraft also exhibited erratic roll movements: right, then left, and again right. Despite the pilot-in-command's attempts to correct the aircraft's attitude using control wheel inputs, the instability continued until impact,\" it adds further.\nThree interim safety recommendations have been issued further by the AAIC, where it has mentioned, \"all airline operators in Nepal must immediately review their speed cards and Reduced Takeoff Weight (RTOW) charts to ensure accuracy and conformity with the aircraft manuals.\"\nAlso, the strict compliance with cargo and baggage handling procedures is mandated for all the operating airlines, where \"every piece of baggage or cargo must be weighed, correctly distributed, and securely fastened using nets or straps.\"\nAlong with the regulatory body, the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal must revise and improve its procedures for granting flight permissions, especially for non-scheduled and ferry flights.\nOn July 24, 2024, the Saurya Airlines Bombardier CRJ 200 aircraft (registration 9N-AME) crashed shortly after takeoff at Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA) in Kathmandu.\nThe aircraft was on a ferry flight to Pokhara for scheduled maintenance, carrying 19 airline personnel, including pilots and engineers. Within seconds of liftoff from runway 02 at around 11:11 AM local time, the plane veered sharply right and crashed near runway 20, erupting in flames.\nRescue teams, including firefighters, police, and army personnel, responded swiftly, extinguishing the fire and recovering the bodies, later sent for autopsy. The crash prompted a temporary shutdown of TIA, disrupting domestic and international flights. The government-formed investigation committee submitted its report following the Saurya Airlines Bombardier CRJ-200 crash that occurred on July 24, 2024. The five-member commission was established immediately after the accident during an emergency Cabinet meeting to determine the causes of the crash.\nIt was led by Ratish Chandra Lal Suman, the former Director General of the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN). The other members were Captain Dipu Jwarchan, Professors Kuldip Bhattarai and Sanjay Adhikari from Pulchowk Engineering Campus, and Mukesh Dangol, an Air Traffic Control Officer at CAAN.\nThe committee completed its investigation and submitted the report, providing detailed findings on the circumstances and factors that led to the tragic accident, which claimed 18 lives.

    "content": "New Delhi, July 18 (SocialNews.XYZ) The Nepal Telecommunications Authority (NTA) on Friday ordered all telecom service providers in the country to block access to the Telegram messaging app.\n\nThis decision came after months of repeated warnings and requests from the Cyber Bureau of Nepal Police, which flagged the app as a tool for financial fraud and money laundering.\n\nIn a statement, the NTA confirmed the directive, stating that the decision was taken in response to serious concerns raised by security agencies.\n\n“As online frauds through Telegram continue to rise in Nepal, and the app is reportedly involved in crimes such as money laundering, all telecom service providers are directed to immediately block Telegram,” NTA stated.\n\nThe authority stated that fraud schemes through Telegram have recently surged. These include fake job offers, crypto scams, and other deceptive tactics.\n\nThe Prime Minister’s Office, the Ministry of Home Affairs, and other key officials held meetings to discuss the issue.\n\nAfter being briefed on several cases of money laundering linked to Telegram, the Prime Minister’s Office sent an official letter to the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology, asking for immediate action.\n\nAnother major reason behind the ban was Telegram’s refusal to cooperate with law enforcement agencies.\n\nThe Ministry tried to contact Telegram’s official representative but couldn’t find a local focal point.\n\nOn Friday, it wrote to the NTA requesting the block. Soon after, the authority instructed all telecom and internet providers to cut off access to the app.\n\nTelegram has long been criticised for being unsafe and for not sharing user data with authorities.\n\nCountries like China have already banned the app due to similar concerns. The controversy surrounding Telegram grew further after its co-founder, Pavel Durov, was arrested in France in August 2024.\n\nDurov, who also co-founded the Russian social network VK, was arrested at Le Bourget Airport and later indicted on multiple charges, including complicity in the distribution of child exploitation material and drug trafficking.\n\nHe was barred from leaving France and placed under judicial supervision. Durov’s arrest led to major protests by free-speech activists and Telegram users.\n\nIn March 2025, a judge allowed Durov to temporarily leave France, and he left the country within the same month.\n\nSource: IANS",

    "title": "'Will visit India at appropriate time,' says Nepal PM Oli",
    "content": "Nepal Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli has said that he will be visiting India and that ground work is underway on both sides for the trip. He, however, did not specify any timeframe for the visit. Oli's comment about his visit to India comes amid speculations by some sections of local media that he didn't receive any invitation from India for an official visit, indicating that his relations with India became sour. \"I will probably embark on a visit to India. My visit to India will take place after the two sides do necessary ground works,\" Oli said in an interview to a Nepalese Youtube channel Dishanirdesh TV late on Thursday. It was in July last year that Oli, the chairperson of the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) - popular as the CPN-UML - assumed the office of Prime Minister for the fourth time.Live Events He had chosen to visit China for his maiden foreign visit, breaking the tradition of visiting India as the first destination after assuming the post of prime minister. Oli also revealed that he had extended an invitation to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to visit Nepal. \"Prime Minister Modi will probably visit Nepal towards November,\" he said adding, \"I have already sent the invitation to him.\" \"My India visit will take place at an appropriate time,\" he added. Modi and Oli met on the sidelines of the 6th BIMSTEC Summit in Bangkok on April 4. Oli also dismissed rumours that India doesn't like him. \"India did nothing bad when I became the Prime Minister,\" he said. In a different context, Oli pointed out, \"We have very good relations with both India and China.\" \"India and China both are rising economic powers and it is good that our neighbours are moving in the path of development,\" he said, adding, Nepal may benefit from the spill over effect of their development. \"They (India and China) should focus attention on their development, but it is not good to be involved in cut-throat competition,\" Oli advised. \"There should be healthy competition between them. They should choose the path of cordial relations, but not a path that bears tension.\" Answering a question how it will affect Nepal if tension prevails between its northern and southern neighbours, Oli said, Nepal will also benefit if there are good relations between India and China. \"We can benefit from cooperation and collaboration with them and also we may benefit from their big market.\" (You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onNepal PM Oli visit to IndiaK P Sharma OliIndia Nepal relationsNepal China relationsModi visit to Nepal\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

    "content": "London, July 18 (SocialNews.XYZ) Acclaimed Bollywood actress and cancer crusader Manisha Koirala spoke candidly about her health and revealed that when she learnt about having the deadly disease, she thought she is “going to die.”\n\nManish also shared her views on politics, life, and work at a special event hosted by Here & Now 365 at The Chambers, Taj 51 Buckingham Gate, London.\n\nReflecting on her personal battle with ovarian cancer in 2012, she shared: “When the doctor told me I had cancer, I thought, this is it. I’m going to die. But by God’s grace, I didn’t. I learned to live again. Resilience isn’t a heroic burst. It’s a series of small choices, made moment by moment,” she said.\n\nIn conversation with Manish Tiwari, founder of Here and Now 365, shared her views on Nepal’s political crisis.\n\n“Every leader undoes what the previous leader did. That’s why democracy doesn’t seem to work in Nepal. No government lasts,” said Koirala.\n\nDescribing herself firmly as a “democrat,” she added: “I believe Nepal needs a monarchy on top so there’s some balance.”\n\nAsked how she balances her family’s political legacy with her own global fame, she said: “I love my country deeply. But I worry, there’s a longing for dignity and stability. We need to rebuild institutions, not just governments.”\n\nThe actress spoke about her Bollywood career spanning over three decades and recalled how she began without formal training.\n\n“I hadn’t even finished Class 12 and suddenly I was standing next to Dilip Kumar and Raj Kumar on a film set!”\n\nShe starred in acclaimed films like ‘1942: A Love Story’, ‘Bombay’, and ‘Dil Se’ but said the fame took a toll on her\n\n“I burned out. I was working 18-19 hours a day… Slowly, I lost direction.”\n\nDuring the discussion, Tiwari suggested she could lead a global film project to showcase Nepal beyond the obvious.\n\nManisha said: “That’s a seed you’ve planted today… let’s see what grows.”\n\nConcluding on a lighter note, she said: “The Koirala women are so liberated, girls want to be a Koirala but no man wants to marry a Koirala girl!”\n\nSource: IANS",

    "title": "A year of rhetoric, broken promises, and weak governance for Nepal’s Oli",
    "content": "Nepal Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli has completed a year in office with the two largest parties — the Nepali Congress and his own CPN-UML — continuing the coalition that they forged with several promises, including amendments to the constitution, good governance, and a boost to development.\n\nWhile promises have remained largely unfulfilled, public dissatisfaction has grown.\n\nAnalysts describe Mr. Oli’s one year in office as unsuccessful across key sectors — governance, legislation, development, and foreign relations.\n\n“It’s a disaster on all fronts,” says Hari Sharma, a political commentator. “If we were to talk about achievements, there is nothing visible… nothing that the people could really feel.”\n\nWhen Mr. Oli signed a seven-point deal with Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba on July 1 last year — which set the stage for Mr. Oli’s fourth stint in power starting two weeks later on July 15 — the message the duo tried to convey was that a strong and stable government was what Nepal needed to usher in stability and ensure good governance.\n\nWith Congress, the single largest party with 88 seats, backing Mr. Oli — whose Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) holds 79 seats — they controlled a comfortable majority in Parliament. But even on the legislative front, the government’s weakness was starkly exposed, triggering public outcry.\n\nAmending the constitution was a core agenda of the two parties. They peddled the idea that the electoral system envisioned by the constitution, promulgated 10 years ago, made it nearly impossible for any single party to secure a majority, inevitably leading to hung parliaments and a cycle of unstable coalition governments.\n\nThey proclaimed that Nepal’s development was stymied by the lack of a stable and strong government.\n\nBut the constitutional amendment was a ruse from the outset, a smokescreen to justify their return to power, say commentators.\n\nWhether the said amendments were even possible is a secondary question; the primary question is whether they ever truly intended to, says Ajaya Bhadra Khanal, research director at the Centre for Social Innovation and Foreign Policy, a Kathmandu-based think tank.\n\n“As a matter of fact, constitutional amendments were never on the Oli government’s agenda. This idea was tossed around to justify the coalition of the two largest parties, which is an unusual practice in parliamentary democracy,” says Mr. Khanal. “What has actually been established over the past year is a politics of collusion, enabling the subversion of the rule of law in the interest of the ruling parties.”\n\nJust as Mr. Oli neared the first anniversary of his government, reports surfaced that one of his Cabinet Ministers was involved in corruption. For several weeks, lawmakers have been raising issues of bad governance and irregularities.\n\nCorruption concerns\n\nMr. Oli, a loquacious leader by nature, is never tired of asserting that he won’t tolerate corruption, but chooses to maintain silence on the issues of irregularities, including those involving Ministers from his own party.\n\n“Forget achievements and progress; under Oli, corruption has been socialised. And this is even more dangerous,” says Tula Shah, a political analyst. “The normalisation of corruption epitomises governance failure.”\n\nA couple of months ago, Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak’s name appeared in connection with a scheme under which millions were allegedly being collected from unsuspecting Nepalis going abroad on visit visas. After a hue and cry in the media and Parliament, the government formed a committee to investigate the matter. By the Oli government’s own admission, the “visit visa scam” had been going on for many years under various governments.\n\nAnalysts say pointing to previous governments is a deflection tactic by the Oli government, when it should have taken stern measures and asked the Home Minister to resign. “No government, or its leader for that matter, can avoid responsibility by claiming it has not committed corruption; checking corruption is the primary duty of any government,” says Mr. Shah. “Implementing strong measures to curb corruption is one of the ways to earn public trust, and the government has failed in this.”\n\nForeign relations fiasco\n\nNepal’s foreign policy is mainly shaped by its relations with two countries — India and China, its two neighbours.\n\nEver since Mr. Oli became Prime Minister for the first time in 2018 — after the promulgation of the constitution in 2015 — he has made a habit of taking India head-on. He used Delhi’s lukewarm response to the constitution and the subsequent border blockade to whip up ultra-nationalist fervor among his political base.\n\nHis relations with New Delhi have not been the best. Yet, ever since assuming office last year, Mr. Oli has been keenly waiting for a visit to India.\n\nIn November, he went to China, in a departure from the general tradition of visiting India first. During the Beijing visit, he secured a deal under the Belt and Road Initiative to carry forward a dozen projects in Nepal with Chinese funding.\n\nHowever, analysts say that does not signify an improved relationship. “We have not seen any progress under that deal as well,” says Mr. Sharma.\n\nAccording to him, Mr. Oli, who never misses a chance to take a jibe at India, has spent the entire year waiting for an invite from Delhi. “There is clearly a lack of trust from both neighbours,” he said. “So, on the foreign policy front as well, Oli has not been successful.”\n\nPublic dissatisfaction\n\nFrom the very outset, the government has earned notoriety for being intolerant of criticism and for its vindictive attitude. Those criticising the government or people in power on social media have been prosecuted through misuse of laws.\n\nIn March, pro-monarchy protests attracted many people — though not all were calling for the monarchy’s return. Many had joined simply to express dissatisfaction with misgovernance. The way the Oli government handled the protests — two people were killed and several others injured — led to more discontent among the general public.\n\nIn recent months, even some members of the ruling parties have voiced criticism of the Oli government over its failures in basic areas like service delivery.\n\nImproved public service delivery is one way to measure how the government is functioning, but on this front too, the current administration has failed miserably, say analysts.\n\n“The dilapidated condition of a major highway is a clear example of the central government’s failure,” says Mr. Sharma. “Over the past year, the road has remained unchanged, which means the government has done nothing.”\n\nA Bill related to civil service was mired in controversy after it was discovered that some interest groups from outside Parliament had influenced the insertion of a provision without lawmakers’ knowledge. After the incident was widely reported, a committee to look into the matter was formed.\n\nBut the episode exposed the weakness of the legislature, where the two big parties control enough seats to pass Bills. A few months ago, the government introduced a flurry of ordinances to change laws it claimed were hindering economic activities. That too raised questions about the “strength” of the government Mr. Oli claims to lead.\n\nIgnoring such incidents that have eroded public faith in the government, Prime Minister Oli’s outrageous daily claims of development and governance come as an affront to the people, commentators say.\n\n“All in all, it’s a rhetoric-filled one year for Mr. Oli,” says Mr. Sharma. “More in talk, nothing in substance.”\n\n(Sanjeev Satgainya is an independent journalist based in Kathmandu)",

    "title": "Opinion: Electoral Roll Revision: Cleanup or calculated move?",
    "content": "By Geetartha Pathak\nThe Election Commission of India has announced that, following the voter list scrutiny in Bihar, a nationwide review will now be undertaken. The reasoning provided is a familiar one: to identify and remove names of foreign nationals, particularly those suspected to be from Bangladesh, Nepal, or Myanmar.\nThe ruling BJP, in turn, has accused opposition parties — especially the Congress and the Left — of encouraging such inclusions in the voter rolls for political gain. The opposition, on the other hand, views this drive as a thinly veiled attempt to suppress their support base and further polarise society.\nSpecial Intensive Revision\nThe Special Intensive Revision (SIR) in Bihar began on June 25, with Booth Level Officers (BLOs) tasked with collecting Enumeration Forms from voters by July 25. A draft electoral roll is scheduled for release on August 1, followed by a claims and objections period. The ECI has specified 11 acceptable documents for voter verification, explicitly excluding Aadhaar, Electors Photo Identity Card (EPIC), and ration cards.\nHowever, in response to petitions challenging the SIR, the Supreme Court, on July 10, urged the ECI to consider including these documents as valid proofs. The court’s final ruling is expected on July 28, just days before the draft list’s publication, leaving the process in a state of uncertainty.\nThe exclusion of widely held documents like Aadhaar and ration cards has raised eyebrows, particularly as these are commonly used for identity verification across India. Critics argue that the ECI’s restrictive approach could disproportionately affect marginalised communities, who may lack access to the specified documents.\nThe Supreme Court’s suggestion to include Aadhaar and ration cards reflects this concern, though the court also noted that the ECI retains the authority to reject any document deemed insufficient. The SIR in Bihar, now extended nationwide, seems to be another step in this long political saga. Officially aimed at “cleansing” voter rolls, it risks becoming a tool for voter suppression and political polarisation. Without legal authority to determine citizenship, the EC’s actions could unjustly strip legitimate citizens of their voting rights.\nAssam Revisited\nThis narrative is not new. In fact, it harks back to the tumultuous events of 1979 in Assam during the Mangaldoi parliamentary by-election. Allegations then arose that a large number of foreign nationals — mainly from Bangladesh — had been registered as voters. This claim triggered the historic Assam Agitation, led by the All Assam Students’ Union (AASU), demanding the identification and deportation of illegal immigrants.\nThe AASU insisted on a cut-off year of 1950 for accepting any migrants from East Pakistan (now Bangladesh). After six years of widespread protests, violence, and negotiations, the Assam Accord was signed in 1985, laying down a legal framework for identifying foreign nationals in the State and setting March 24, 1971, as the cut-off date for citizenship.\nHowever, the real challenge began after the Accord. The AASU and others pushed for effective legal mechanisms such as the repeal of the IMDT (Illegal Migrants Determination by Tribunal) Act, which they claimed hindered the detection of illegal immigrants. The Supreme Court struck down the IMDT Act in 2005, terming it unconstitutional. Despite this, the detection and deportation of foreign nationals remained elusive.\nThe Election Commission is not empowered to detect or determine foreign nationals, as this is the prerogative of agencies like the Ministry of Home Affairs or the Foreigners Tribunals\nIn response, a massive exercise was launched — the updating of the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Assam. After years of work and monitoring by the Gauhati High Court, the final NRC was published in 2019, which excluded around 19 lakh individuals. Ironically, a large number of those excluded were Hindus — contradicting the BJP’s political narrative that illegal immigrants were primarily Muslim Bangladeshis.\nMeanwhile, the government brought in the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), aimed at providing citizenship to persecuted Hindus and other minorities from Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh. But this too sparked a nationwide controversy, as many saw it as a move to offer citizenship on religious grounds while marginalising Muslims selectively.\nDespite decades of agitation, legal reforms, and costly bureaucratic exercises, the government has failed to identify or deport even a few hundred foreign nationals conclusively. This glaring inefficiency raises a fundamental question: Is the issue of illegal immigration a real security threat or merely a recurring political tool?\nUnanswered Questions\nThe government’s current strategy — of deleting names from voter lists instead of legally identifying and deporting foreign nationals — is analogous to striking someone’s name off a guest list without actually showing them the door. If there truly are foreign nationals living illegally, why not initiate lawful identification and deportation processes, rather than relying on unverifiable assumptions and mass deletions from electoral rolls?\nThis move also raises serious constitutional and legal questions. The Election Commission has no power to decide who is a citizen or a foreign national. Its role is limited to maintaining accurate electoral rolls based on documents submitted by applicants. It is not empowered to detect or determine foreign nationals, as this is the prerogative of agencies like the Ministry of Home Affairs or the Foreigners Tribunals under due legal process. If the EC has no authority to determine citizenship, how can it delete names from voter lists merely on the assumption that certain individuals are foreigners?\nSuch actions not only violate due process but also risk disenfranchising genuine Indian citizens, particularly marginalised communities who often face documentation issues. The answer may lie in the politics of polarisation.\nJust as the Assam Agitation served as a powerful emotional trigger in the late 20th century, the present nationwide campaign may be aimed at reigniting nationalist sentiments — this time on a broader, national stage. With general elections in a number of States approaching, the narrative of protecting Indian sovereignty from ‘foreign infiltrators’ can be a potent campaign tool.\nAt What Cost?\nBut this political theatre comes at a cost — social harmony, bureaucratic integrity, and the credibility of democratic processes. India needs a balanced approach rooted in law and justice, not political expediency. If the state has credible intelligence and evidence, it should proceed with legal deportation mechanisms, respecting due process. Otherwise, repeated claims of “lakhs of foreign nationals” only serve to sow distrust and division among communities.\nIn the end, the issue appears to be less about actual foreign nationals and more about the strategic positioning of parties in the political battleground. As the BJP seemingly replays the Assam agitation on a national scale, one is compelled to ask: Is this really about national security, or just another chapter in the politics of manufactured threats?\n(The author is a senior journalist from Assam)",

    "title": "Twelve Days That Changed the Middle East: How the Iran-Israel War Redefined Regional Power Dynamics and Global Military Doctrine",
    "content": "Laxman Singh Dev\n\nThe Iran-Israel war, also known as the Twelve-Day War, fundamentally shattered many longstanding assumptions in global geopolitics and military strategy. Spanning from June 13 to June 24, 2025, this brief yet intense conflict revealed the decades of meticulous preparation both countries had engaged in, despite the considerable geographical distance—over 1,500 kilometers aerial distance separating their capitals and with Iraq and Jordan lying between them.\n\nIsrael initiated the conflict with a surprise aerial and ground assault aimed at crippling Iran’s nuclear ambitions. The strikes targeted key military and nuclear sites, including Tehran, Natanz uranium enrichment facility, and underground missile depots in Kermanshah and Tabriz. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) employed cutting-edge stealth aircraft, such as the F-35I Adir and F-15I Ra’am, flying over 200 sorties and disabling upwards of 70 surface-to-air missile systems, effectively neutralizing Iran’s air defenses. This precision was backed by intelligence successes from Mossad and Unit 8200, Israel’s elite cyber and intelligence units that had spent months gathering actionable information. One notable example was the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, which was believed to have been coordinated from within Iran’s borders, highlighting Israel’s deep infiltration capabilities.\n\nIn response, Iran launched waves of missile and drone strikes against Israeli cities and military sites—more than 550 ballistic missiles and over 1,000 explosive drones were deployed in Operation True Promise 3—causing explosions over densely populated areas like Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. Iran also enlisted proxy actors, most notably the Houthis in Yemen, to fire missiles toward Israel, further intensifying the regional scope of the conflict. The United States soon joined the warfront, conducting airstrikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities using B-2 bombers equipped with Massive Ordnance Penetrators, a strategic move that reflected Washington’s commitment to Israel’s security while aiming to curb Iran’s nuclear progress.\n\nDuring the conflict, Israel was able to assassinate numerous Iranian senior commanders by precisely targeting their residences and even bedrooms, an indication of the highly sophisticated intelligence network in place. Reports suggest that Israel had also been operating covert missile and drone assembly factories inside Iran, employing impoverished Afghan migrant laborers, whose status became precarious as Iran expelled nearly 700,000 undocumented Afghans amid fears of espionage.\n\nEconomically, the war plunged Iran deeper into turmoil. Already grappling with inflation soaring at around 40% annually over the past five years and rising U.S. dollar valuation, the damages inflicted on over 11,000 Iranian government and military sites exacerbated hardships. Residential buildings in affluent Tehran neighborhoods like Pasdaran, Elahiyeh, and Zafranieh were destroyed, demoralizing the populace and causing a property value collapse due to security concerns.\n\nFrom a regional and global perspective, Iran’s missile attacks on Israeli cities forced Israeli citizens to take shelter in bunkers, highlighting the fragile security situation. Though Israel’s retaliatory bombings of Gaza following Hamas’ October 7, 2023 attack resulted in devastating civilian casualties—around 55,000, including 15,000 children—the world largely perceived Israel as an aggressor, tarnishing its international image. In contrast, Iran consolidated its standing among many in the global Islamic community, portrayed as a resilient defender in what was perceived as an asymmetrical struggle. This enhanced the prestige of Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, and bolstered Iran’s emergence as a Middle Eastern middle power asserting itself militarily and diplomatically.\n\nThe war also revealed evolving warfare dynamics—hybrid in nature, blending cyber warfare, intelligence, psychological operations, and precision strikes across multiple domains. While Israel maintained aerial superiority and employed advanced mechanisms to neutralize Iran’s missile capabilities, Iran adapted by leveraging its proxies and asymmetric warfare tactics.\n\nStrategically, the conflict underscored Iran’s mixed relationships with global powers. Frustrated by Russia’s cautious diplomacy, Iran sought to deepen ties with China, aiming for military and technological alliances, anticipating future geopolitical shifts in response to perceived Western hostility.\n\nUltimately, despite Iran’s bold missile campaigns and asymmetric responses, the war concluded with a U.S.-brokered ceasefire on June 24, reflecting the desire to avoid further escalation in a volatile region. The conflict, nonetheless, redefined military preparedness, regional alliances, and the geopolitical landscape of the Middle East, marking a pivotal moment in the enduring Israel-Iran rivalry.\n\nThis war was not just a military confrontation but a demonstration of intelligence warfare, proxy engagement, and diplomatic maneuvering that will shape the strategic calculus in the region for years to come.The question is, what did Iran gain from this war? What did it achieve through this well-resisted conflict? For Iranians already struggling with poor economic conditions, the war brought more inflation and destruction. The dollar rate increased again. Inflation in Iran has been growing at 40% annually for the last five years. Israel attacked over 11,000 government sites inside Iran, including secret agencies and military sites. Ordinary Iranian citizens were shocked to see that what they thought were ordinary residential houses were government offices. In Tehran’s Pasdaran neighborhood, nearly half a kilometer of buildings were destroyed in Israeli attacks. Attacks were made on the homes of government officials and those associated with the government in some of northern Tehran’s most expensive areas like Elahiyeh, Zafranieh, Karmanieh, and Andarjagu. So many attacks caused property values in these areas to fall as they were considered unsafe.\n\nOn the other hand, from a global perspective, Iran gave a strong reply to Israel, forcing Israeli citizens to hide in bunkers. After Hamas’s attack on October 7, 2023, Israel retaliated with strikes on Gaza to free hostages, killing about 55,000 civilians, including 15,000 children. This made Israel appear as a terrorist state worldwide. Iran’s attacks elevated its stature globally, especially in the global Islamic community, casting it as a hero. Trump exercised restraint in acting openly against Iran, though openly attacking an American Air Force base is a major issue. Iran adopted a do-or-die policy in this war. Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei’s position and reputation were further enhanced, and Iran established itself as a middle power.\n\n*Dr laxman Singh “Dev” is an expert of middle East society and politics . he has been part of top iranian think tanks .he lives in Iran.he has done his PhD on the subject of dalit political art of India and nepal. travelled extensively in middle East and Nepal for ethnographic research.\n\n*Opinions expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect The Asia Live’s Editorial Policy.",

    "title": "Ties in region back in focus with PM’s forthcoming visit to Maldives",
    "content": "Ties in the neighbourhood will come back into focus next week as Prime Minister Narendra Modi will visit Male on July 25-26 for the Independence Day of the Maldives, and sources say a long-pending visit by Nepal’s Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli to New Delhi is being planned shortly after his return.\n\nMr. Modi was expected to travel to the U.K. to sign the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, but officials said the trip, which is still being planned for July 24, has not been “finalised” and could be delayed.\n\nMr. Modi is expected to land in Male on July 25, and will be given a ceremonial welcome. He will hold bilateral talks with Maldives’ President Mohamed Muizzu, who visited India in June 2024 for Mr. Modi’s swearing-in ceremony and then for a State visit in October. Among a number of development initiatives, both sides are expected to build on the launch of digital payment system UPI and mechanisms to increase tourist arrivals between both countries, officials working on the visit said.\n\nOn July 26, Mr. Modi has been invited as a guest to the Independence Day parade and other special ceremonies to mark 60 years of the Maldives getting independence from the British in 1965. The invitation was announced by Maldives Foreign Minister Abdulla Khaleel during his visit to India in May this year.\n\nOfficials said that India and the U.K. have also been discussing a short visit to London by Mr. Modi before he travels to Male, on July 24, to sign the FTA that was announced by him and Mr. Starmer on May 6. However, it is understood that some technical and “legal scrubbing” is still required to be finished, and the trip may require to be put off or held after the Male visit.\n\nThe visit to the Maldives is significant as it marks Mr. Modi’s first visit to the neighbouring country since the election of Mr. Muizzu in November 2023. Ties between India and Maldives hit a rough patch over the “India Out” campaign that Mr. Muizzu had backed during his campaign, and the “Boycott Maldives” social media campaign that followed over criticism of Mr. Modi by Maldivian Ministers.\n\nHowever, the two sides subsequently resolved issues, after India agreed to replace military personnel stationed there for aircraft management with civilian engineers. India has also increased its Lines of Credit and outlay to Maldives from ₹470 crore in 2024-25 to ₹600 crore in the latest budget, and extended a much needed currency swap facility to help Maldives with its debt repayment crisis last year.\n\nDiplomatic sources further said that India is expected to host Nepal’s Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli later this month and that discussions are on.\n\nMr. Oli was one of the first regional leaders to condemn the terrorist attack in Pahalgam and, subsequently, India accommodated Nepalese citizens while airlifting stranded nationals from Iran against the backdrop of the Iran-Israel conflict.\n\nMr. Oli in recent months, has also praised India for supporting the democratic process in post-monarchy Nepal. While plans are underway for the visit, there are also internal political developments in Nepal that will be taken into consideration at the planning stage. On Wednesday (July 16, 2025), Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal (JSP-N), withdrew support to Mr. Oli’s government, reducing the ruling coalition to a minority in the Upper House of the Nepalese Parliament — National Assembly.\n\nMr. Oli’s India proposed visit has acquired heightened attention as he was sworn in on July 15, 2024 but has not visited India till now, but had visited China in December last year.",

Issuing a statement, the party has given 11 reasons to end support to the government led by Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli. The party has stated that the government has failed to ensure good governance to the people, control corruption, irregularities, impunity, improve the country's economy, unbalanced and biased budget, as reasons to withdraw the support.

Following JSP-N's exit, it now commands just 28 seats.

    "content": "Kolkata, July 16 (SocialNews.XYZ) The Leader of the Opposition (LoP) in West Bengal Assembly, Suvendu Adhikari, on Wednesday stressed the need for a door-to-door review to identify the illegal Rohingya infiltrators who have managed to get their names enrolled in the voters’ list of the state.\n\n“In the Special Intensive Review conducted by the Election Commission of India in Bihar, which is going for polls this year, a few lakh illegal Rohingya infiltrators have been identified.

    "title": "Opinion | SIR, Could We Have Voters’ List Reforms With Some ICE, Please?",
    "content": "The djinns are everywhere. They travel as if borders do not exist. They take over land, usurp cultures, snatch jobs. And the djinns have also filled up voter lists and ballot boxes for the parties of their political masters, or the ones who gave them fake papers and shelters.\nNow that the Election Commission (EC) has started a hunt to track down the genies—starting with Bihar which goes to polls this year—their political masters are panicking. More than 35 lakh names are set to be excluded from Bihar’s electoral roll because of the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) process being carried out in the state.\nSo far, 6.6 crore or 88.18 per cent of the total voters in the state have submitted their enumeration forms. The deadline is July 25, after which the draft electoral roll will be published.\nThe EC has shared statistics, which show 12.5 lakh or 1.59 per cent of electors have died but their names remain on the list. Another 2.2 per cent, or 17.5 lakh electors, have permanently moved out of Bihar. Around 5.5 lakh or 0.73 per cent voters have registered twice. This adds up to 35.5 lakh existing voters or 4.5 per cent of the total electorate facing removal from Bihar’s voter list. It does not include illegal immigrants from Nepal, Bangladesh, and Myanmar, whom EC teams busted during field visits, who were registered as voters. These names will also be removed after verification.\nThe Supreme Court, which is currently hearing petitions related to the SIR, has advised the EC to use Aadhaar cards, ration cards, and voter ID cards for voter verification.\nAn overwhelming part of illegal immigrants are Muslims from Bangladesh and Myanmar. In Bihar districts like Kishanganj, which has 68 per cent Muslims, for instance, Aadhaar card saturation reportedly stands at 126 per cent. Katihar, with 44 per cent Muslims, has 123 per cent Aadhaar card saturation, Araria has 123 per cent, and Purnia has 121 per cent. So, these districts have more than 120 Aadhaar cards for every 100 people.\nThis fraud and assault on the system obviously benefits ‘secular’ parties like the Congress and RJD, who are now blue with rage. The TMC in West Bengal, a case study in minority appeasement politics, has threatened agitation to stop the purge of illegals from the electoral rolls.\nOne hopes the Centre and the courts won’t buckle.\nBut just cleaning the voter lists is not enough. Since the process is making large-scale detection of illegals possible, it should be followed by detention and deportation. That is exactly what the Donald Trump administration has been doing in America through relentless raids by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement or ICE.\nPresident Trump came into office promising the largest mass deportation in US history, targeting what he claimed were 10 million unauthorised migrants living in the US.\nAs a result of the ICE raids, data shows border crossings have plummeted, arrests have doubled, and the number of people in detention is at an all-time high, reports NBC. Migrants in ICE detention on July 7, 2025, stood at 57,186. Of them, 28.6 per cent have criminal convictions, 25 per cent have pending criminal charges, 47.5 per cent were listed as “other immigration violator”, and 11.7 per cent have been fast-tracked for deportation.\nCumulative border crossings have come down to 1,08,658 (year to date, 2025) from 9,05,920 (YTD, 2024), which was 88 per cent higher. Border crossings stood at 9,25,919 (YTD, 2023), 88.3 per cent higher than this year. \nThe number of people deported by ICE has not been regularly released, but NBC News claims it has internal ICE data, which shows 15,000-18,000 are being deported each month lately.\nIndia needs an ICE-style purge. While there are mostly unconfirmed reports about India stealthily pushing back Bangladeshi illegals by the hundreds since Operation Sindoor, the drive has to be more robust and decisive. Else, the djinns will continue to ravage Bharat’s demography, and ultimately, its destiny. \nAbhijit Majumder is a senior journalist.

    "title": "Improving climate adaptation governance in Nepal and Laos - Devpolicy Blog from the Development Policy Centre",
    "content": "In June, the OECD’s Development Assistance Committee (DAC) convened the Civil Society Days forum in Paris. Held every two years, the forum aims to strengthen dialogue, collaboration and mutual understanding between the OECD and civil society organisations on a wide range of policy issues. Among many pressing topics right now, the OECD has recently put a lot of work into supporting DAC members to improve their efforts to support “climate change adaptation governance more effectively”. The convoluted name is enough to suggest that this is complex stuff.\n\nIn contrast to climate mitigation, which works at a global level and has targets and emissions accounting models, adaptation to the impacts of climate change is highly — perhaps entirely — context-specific. The ability of communities to adapt to climate change depends, therefore, not just on new technologies or the ever-increasing proliferation of funding mechanisms, but on whose perspective and knowledge counts in addressing climate vulnerabilities and risks, and on how local governance systems can enable or restrict effective action. Therefore, the effectiveness of adaptation efforts relies heavily on the extent to which the political dynamics of governance from national to local levels are navigated.\n\nThe Asia Foundation’s (TAF) experience through the Subnational Governance Program (2017–2027) in Nepal, and the Community-Based River Basin Management (2018–2027) project in the Lao People’s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), offers insights into how climate adaptation unfolds through the often-incremental work of negotiating power, navigating institutions and enabling local agency.\n\nBoth Nepal and Lao PDR are highly climate-vulnerable countries. In Nepal, changing rainfall patterns, glacial melt and increasingly erratic monsoons have led to more frequent floods, droughts and landslides. In many parts of the country, vulnerable communities — especially women, landless farmers and members of marginalised communities — are often hardest hit by climate-induced disasters and the slow-onset impacts of climate change. In Lao PDR, climate risks are compounded by extensive hydropower development, deforestation and shifting weather cycles that disrupt rural livelihoods and exacerbate flood and drought events. In the Xe Bang Fai River basin — a river vital for flood regulation, sediment transport and seasonal hydrology for farming for around a quarter of a million people — communities face mounting pressure on wetlands and water systems from both climate change and human interventions.\n\nIn both countries, the governance systems are deeply constrained from addressing these issues.\n\nNepal’s 2015 federal constitution devolved significant authority to local governments but many municipalities were initially left under-resourced, under-skilled for the necessary tasks and politically fragmented. Ten years on, elected officials find challenges in prioritising long-term climate-resilient planning and prefer relatively immediate and visible infrastructure projects that highlight their political power, at the expense of affected communities’ concerns. In general, the participation of communities in governance, particularly women and those from marginalised groups, tends to be of lesser priority and even tokenistic.\n\nIn Lao PDR, meanwhile, environmental governance is highly centralised. Decisions around water, land use and natural resource management are made at the national or provincial level, with limited community input. Community roles are often limited to compliance rather than participatory decision making.\n\nLand belongs to local government, forest grown in the land belongs to province government, and the trees in the forest belong to federal government. — Surendra Raj Pandey, Chief Minister, Gandaki Province, Nepal\n\nIn Nepal, the Subnational Governance Program team worked with municipalities, civil society and community actors across two provinces to build inclusive local governance systems that could enable — not bypass — climate-responsive planning. Rather than frame adaptation as a technical agenda, it was embedded in existing governance processes by working with relevant officials at all levels of government. Through support for participatory planning, social audits and grievance redress systems, communities have been able to shape local budgets and development priorities.\n\nCrucially, over several years, municipal leaders began to see that inclusive governance was not a distraction, but a way to enhance political legitimacy and public performance. Mayors and ward chairs who initially viewed participatory planning as time-consuming began to see its value in generating trust, mobilising co-financing and demonstrating responsiveness to constituents — especially after disasters. Climate priorities — such as flood control, resilient agriculture or safe water access — were introduced into local plans because local actors advocated for them, not because they were imposed from outside. This made adaptation locally owned and contextually grounded.\n\nIn the Lao PDR context where formal community engagement is limited, the Community-Based River Basin Management project used technical entry points — like water quality monitoring and hazard mapping — to open space for joint planning and community voice. By working with provincial and district agencies to train staff in groundwater and surface water monitoring, community geographic information system mapping and gender-sensitive hazard and vulnerability assessments, interest and engagement with climate vulnerabilities increased. At the same time, TAF facilitated community participation in hands-on exercises to identify flood zones, assess risks and co-produce community vulnerability maps.\n\nThrough this shared learning process, community members became co-owners of knowledge, not just sources of data and “beneficiaries” of policies. District officers, initially cautious about participatory approaches, began to see communities as valuable partners in flood preparedness and wetland protection. Perhaps most importantly, the project helped establish the Healthy River Network — now a long-term, multi-stakeholder coalition in which government officials, communities and civil society meet regularly to discuss risks and coordinate action. In a hierarchical governance system, this created a politically safe space for horizontal collaboration and vertical feedback.\n\nThe outcomes of both initiatives point to important shifts in governance practice that matter for climate resilience at the community level.\n\nBoth cases highlight that effective climate adaptation is not just about building more resilient local infrastructure and providing government agencies with improved technical skills. It is about supporting politically feasible changes to the institutional arrangements that make adaptation possible and locally legitimate. The most climate-vulnerable communities are often those with the least power in decision-making. Enabling their involvement in local decision-making requires more than participation: it requires shifts in how local governance institutions operate and whose voice is considered credible.\n\nBy implication, climate finance and policy must go hand-in-hand with governance reform if adaptation is to be locally led and sustainable. As the impact of the climate crisis continues to be felt inequitably within and between countries, global efforts to enable adaptation must start from understanding how power is distributed and how decisions are made locally, and from there, to how communities can act together to be more resilient. It raises the question of whether this kind of approach can help bridge the pervasive gap between nationally determined contribution commitments and local action plans. Because even in constrained settings like these, change is possible when governance initiatives are politically smart, locally grounded and built on trust.\n\nAn earlier version of this blog was delivered as a presentation at the OECD Civil Society Days in June 2025.",

    "title": "India News | South Asia Achieves Record Immunization Coverage; India, Nepal Lead Progress: WHO-UNICEF",
    "content": "New Delhi, Jul 15 (PTI) South Asia has achieved its highest-ever immunization coverage for children, with notable progress in India and Nepal, according to new data released on Tuesday by the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF for 2024. India reduced its number of zero-dose children — those who have not received a single vaccine — by 43 per cent, from 1.6 million in 2023 to 0.9 million in 2024. Nepal achieved a 52 per cent reduction, from 23,000 to 11,000, a WHO statement said.

Pakistan also recorded its highest-ever DTP3 (Diphtheria, Tetanus, Pertussis) coverage at 87 per cent. However, Afghanistan continued to struggle, with the lowest coverage in the region and a one percentage point decline since last year, it added. The progress marks a milestone in the region's efforts to protect every child from vaccine-preventable diseases. Also Read | Smriti Irani Taking a Sabbatical From Politics? 'Kyunki SaaS Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi' Actress Says 'Never Compromised on My Sangathan Responsibilities'. \"This is a proud moment for South Asia. More children are protected today than ever before, thanks to tireless frontline health workers, strong government leadership, donors' and partners' support and the unwavering trust of families,\" said Sanjay Wijesekera, UNICEF Regional Director for South Asia. \"But we cannot forget the millions of children who are under-vaccinated or unvaccinated. Now is the time to push further, especially into the most rural areas, to give every child his or her right to healthcare in the earliest years of life,\" he said. In 2024, 92 per cent of infants in South Asia received the third dose of the DTP vaccine — a crucial global indicator — up two percentage points from 2023. The first-dose DTP coverage rose from 93 to 95 per cent, showing a strong recovery beyond pre-COVID levels, the statement said. There was also a 27 per cent drop in zero-dose children across the region, from 2.5 million in 2023 to 1.8 million in 2024. The region also made significant strides in measles control. In 2024, 93 per cent of infants received the first dose and 88 per cent the second dose of the measles vaccine, up from 90 per cent and 87 per cent respectively. Measles cases fell 39 per cent -- from over 90,000 in 2023 to about 55,000 this year. However, coverage still remains below the 95 per cent threshold needed to prevent outbreaks, the statement said. \"It is heartening to see WHO South-East Asia Region reach the highest ever immunization rates, surpassing the pre-pandemic up-trend. We must build on this momentum and step up efforts to reach every child with these lifesaving vaccines. Together we can, and we must,\" said Dr Thaksaphon Thamarangsi, Director Programme Management, WHO South-East Asia Region. HPV vaccination coverage for adolescent girls rose from 2 per cent in 2023 to 9 per cent in 2024. Bangladesh made significant progress, vaccinating over 7.1 million girls since launching its programme in 2023. Bhutan, Maldives, and Sri Lanka also increased their HPV coverage by 3 percentage points (91 per cent to 94 per cent), 15 points (60 per cent to 75 per cent), and 17 points (31 per cent to 48 per cent) respectively. Nepal launched its national HPV vaccination campaign in February 2025 and has vaccinated over 1.4 million girls. India and Pakistan are expected to roll out their HPV vaccination programmes later this year, the statement said. Behind these gains are sustained government efforts, investments, policies, and the dedication of frontline and community health workers—many of them women—alongside donor and partner support. Use of digital tools, improved data systems, and targeted outreach campaigns have also played a key role, it said. While significant progress was made, over 2.9 million children in the region remain un- or under-vaccinated and therefore unprotected, the statement said. With this in mind, UNICEF and WHO urged governments in South Asia to sustain political commitment, increase domestic financing for immunization, expand HPV vaccine coverage, and intensify efforts to reach zero-dose and under-vaccinated children. They also called for greater investment in frontline health workers and reinforcement of surveillance systems for vaccine-preventable diseases.

    "content": "July 15 (UPI) -- A federal appeals court has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from stripping deportation protections from thousands of Afghans in the country.\n\nThe unsigned order from the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals in Virginia came Monday, the same day about 11,700 Afghans in the United States were to lose their Temporary Protected Status.\n\nThe order maintains TPS for Afghan migrants until July 21.\n\nThe ruling came in response to a request by CASA, an immigration advocacy group.\n\nPresident Donald Trump won re-election following a campaign that used derogatory rhetoric and misinformation about migrants, while vowing to conduct mass deportations.\n\nSince returning to office, he has used his presidential powers to deport migrants and limit immigration, including ending TPS for migrants from Afghanistan and Cameroon on April 12.\n\nThe next month, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced the designation for Afghanistan would be terminated on July 14.\n\n\"We've reviewed the conditions in Afghanistan with our interagency partners, and they do not meet the requirements for a TPS designation,\" she said.\n\nThe move has attracted criticism because many of the Afghans with TPS protection were permitted to enter the United States following the U.S. military withdrawal from the war-torn country in 2021. It has since returned to Taliban rule.\n\nPrior to the order on Monday, the National Immigration Forum warned that ending TPS designation for Afghanistan would disrupt thousands of lives, harm their U.S. communities and remove essential workers from the workforce.\n\n\"These individuals are not only our allies, but our friends, employees and neighbors,\" Jennie Murray, president and CEO of the National Immigration Forum, said in a statement.\n\n\"Since so many of those losing their protections served alongside U.S. forces, we should honor that service by upholding our promise to provide safety and ensure that they have an opportunity to thrive here.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has also sought to end TPS designations for Haiti, Venezuela, Nepal, Nicaragua and Honduras.",

    "content": "An appeals court has briefly extended temporary protected status (TPS) for nearly 12,000 Afghans in the United States, hours before it was to expire.\n\nMonday’s order came 60 days after the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) under President Donald Trump announced that it was ending the legal protections for thousands of Afghans legally living in the United States.\n\nThe order by the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Richmond, Virginia, granted an administrative stay on the termination until Monday after a request from the immigration advocacy organisation CASA.\n\nThe appeals court gave no reason for its decision but indicated it would be deciding what to do swiftly.\n\nCASA had sought an emergency stay on Monday when the protection of Afghans was due to be terminated, court documents showed.\n\nIts case also includes Cameroonians whose TPS is to end on August 4.\n\nThe immigrant advocacy group said the step to remove the status was arbitrary and discriminatory and would cause “irreparable harm” to those affected.\n\nThe court has asked both sides to submit briefs this week.\n\nThe Trump administration has until 11:59pm US Eastern time on Wednesday (03:59 GMT on Thursday) to respond.\n\nA federal judge on Friday allowed the lawsuit to go forward but didn’t grant CASA’s request to keep the protections in place while the lawsuit plays out.\n\nThe stay is not a final decision but gives time for the legal challenge, said Shawn VanDiver, founder of AfghanEvac, the main coalition of US military veterans and advocacy groups that coordinates resettlements of Afghan refugees with the government.\n\n“AfghanEvac stands firmly behind the legal challenge and calls on DHS and the Trump administration to immediately reverse course and extend TPS protections,” VanDiver said in an email to the Reuters news agency.\n\nThat status had allowed Afghans to live and work in the US and meant the government could not deport them.\n\nMillions of Afghans who fled their country over previous decades are now being forced back to Taliban-ruled Afghanistan from countries including Iran, Pakistan and the US.\n\nDeportations of Afghans are also anticipated in Germany as its government seeks talks with the Taliban.\n\nAbout 180,000 Afghans have come to the US since the Taliban retook control of the country in 2021. About 11,700 of them are currently covered by TPS.\n\nWhen Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem ended temporary protected status for Afghans, the department wrote in the decision that the situation in their home country was getting better.\n\n“The Secretary determined that, overall, there are notable improvements in the security and economic situation such that requiring the return of Afghan nationals to Afghanistan does not pose a threat to their personal safety due to armed conflict or extraordinary and temporary conditions,” according to the May announcement.\n\nBut rights advocates said many Afghans who helped the US during its war in Afghanistan would be targets of the Taliban if they return home.\n\nParticularly at risk would be women, whose rights the Taliban have rolled back since its return to power after the US withdrawal, rights groups said.\n\nThe International Criminal Court last week issued arrest warrants for two top Taliban leaders in Afghanistan on charges related to abuses against women and girls.\n\n“While the Taliban have imposed certain rules and prohibitions on the population as a whole, they have specifically targeted girls and women by reason of their gender, depriving them of fundamental rights and freedoms,” the court said in a statement.\n\nThe US homeland security secretary may grant TPS to people from specific countries.\n\nCountries that are currently designated for TPS include Afghanistan, Myanmar, Cameroon, El Salvador, Ethiopia, Haiti, Honduras, Lebanon, Nepal, Nicaragua, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, Ukraine, Venezuela and Yemen.\n\nIn addition to Afghanistan and Cameroon, the Trump administration has moved to end the designation for an estimated 260,000 Haitians and 350,000 Venezuelans.\n\nThe Trump administration has also announced it will revoke the two-year “humanitarian parole” of about 530,000 people in the US, including Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans.",

    "title": "Revival of Hindu Politics in Nepal: An Interview with Biswas Baral",
    "content": "This is the transcript of an interview conducted for the July episode of Beyond the Indus, The Diplomat's South Asia-focused podcast. Tushar (Interviewer): Today, we're happy to be joined by Biswas Baral, the editor of the Kathmandu Post, Nepal's most widely read English daily. With over two decades of experience in Nepali journalism, Biswas frequently writes articles on Nepali politics and foreign policy for several international outlets, including The Diplomat. He also has a fascinating YouTube series called Idea of Nepal, where he has wide-ranging discussions on Nepal's history, politics, economy, and foreign policy. He's perhaps the best person to talk to about the rise, or perhaps the revival, of Hindu politics in Nepal. Biswas, welcome to Beyond the Indus, and thank you so much for joining the podcast. Biswas Baral: Thank you so much, Tushar. It's lovely to be here. Tushar: Nepal was once the world's only official Hindu state, ruled over by a semi-divine monarch since, I suspect, the mid-18th century. That state of affairs lasted, not without change, but it did last until 2008 when a popular revolution ousted the last king, Gyanendra* Shah. Just to begin with, could you give our listeners a brief outline of the politics of Nepal under the monarchy and the transition and circumstances that led to its fall in 2008? Biswas Baral: When we talk about monarchy, its history begins in the mid-18th century when Prithvi Narayan* Shah founded modern-day Nepal. The kings were the main rulers under the Shahs* for nearly 100 years, and then they were not ousted but made secondary rulers by the Ranas*, who were a family of courtiers who took over executive powers. This happened in the mid-19th century, and this rule of a single family lasted for 104 years until it was overthrown in 1951. When the Rana rule ended in 1951, the king came back into the picture as the head of state and as a constitutional monarch. In 1951, when the king was restored and the Rana rule ended, he was restored with the promise that he would hold constituent assembly elections and hand over power to a democratic government. However, this could not happen for the next eight years until Nepal had its first parliamentary elections in 1959, whereupon a democratic government was brought in. But it lasted maybe a year and a half before the monarch took over again and started a one-party rule, which lasted until 1990. In 1990, there was a popular protest, and again, the era of active kingship ended and constitutional monarchy was restored. After that, in 1996, the Maoist insurgency started. The Maoists aimed to overthrow the democratically elected government and wanted to establish a dictatorship of the proletariat. Then you come to 2001, while the war against the Maoists was at its peak. The entire royal family was massacred. This is a very crucial point in the history of Nepali monarchy because when the royal family was massacred in 2001, the earlier king was much more popular and well-liked. The new king who came in his place, Gyanendra*, was always unpopular. He was known for his dubious ways. His son was involved in various crimes, including running over a popular Nepalese singer. They were extremely unpopular. When King Gyanendra* came to power in 2001, I think many people lost their faith in monarchy. That was the first big blow to the institution of monarchy in Nepal. Tushar: I just wonder if you could go into the detail of what exactly happened there, because was it someone from the royal family who did the massacre? Biswas Baral: Yes, the official version is that the Crown Prince gunned down his entire family. He was intoxicated and shot his entire family. Many Nepalis don't believe that version. They somehow think that Gyanendra* had something to do with it. But the official version is that the Crown Prince shot the entire family when he was intoxicated, supposedly because his family would not let him marry the woman of his choice. Tushar: I was wondering if you could give us an overview of the political transition from monarchy to secular democracy and the subsequent post-2008 politics of Nepal. Who are the major parties, which communities formed the base of support, and how has their performance been in terms of governance and stability? In your view, has the current political arrangement and the current parties lived up to their social contract that the Nepali people expected of them? Biswas Baral: Before I go to post-2008 politics, it's very important to cover the period between 2001 and 2008. Gyanendra* came to power and subsequently took over executive powers, dismissing the elected government. On one hand, the Maoist war was raging. On the other hand, he had alienated all the political parties. What happened is that the Maoists and these political parties came together and jointly launched a movement to remove the monarchy. By this time, the king had become extremely unpopular because he had suspended democratic rights and had jailed leaders and civil society members. The earliest suspicions people had about him were heightened. By the time he was removed in 2008, a major section of Nepalese believed that he was unfit for the role and somehow supported his removal. Now, there can be an argument that many people supported the removal of just King Gyanendra*, not the monarchy, but that's a debate which continues to this day. In 2006, the seven main political parties at the time and the Maoists signed an agreement in New Delhi whereby they agreed to elect a Constituent Assembly and whereby the Maoists would come back into mainstream politics. Kingship and monarchy were kept in deep freeze in 2006. After the Constituent Assembly election in 2008, when the Maoists and all the anti-monarchy forces came to the Constituent Assembly, they formally removed monarchy. The institution of monarchy was formally abolished in 2008. Since 2008, and actually since 1990 after the first political change, the two main political parties in Nepal are the Nepali Congress and the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist), or CPN-UML*. After 2008, the Maoists also entered the scene. So right now, there are three main parties: the Nepali Congress, the CPN-UML*, and the Maoist Unified Center*. These three are the main political actors. Tushar: Where do they draw their basis of support? Is it similar to India, where you have certain castes and communities that tend to drift towards parties, or is there a different setup in Nepal? Biswas Baral: Right now, if you look at the support base of Nepali Congress, it's generally more liberal and believes in liberal values. The CPN-UML* is a Communist Party by name, but there's nothing communist about it. They have absolutely diluted whatever programs they had adopted. Even in the case of Maoists, the agendas they waged war with, they have step-by-step abandoned all those agendas. Initially, at least, the left parties like CPN-UML* and Maoists were the parties of the proletariat—the farmers, laborers, and low-wage earners—while Nepali Congress attracted those who didn't believe in communist values and thought the country could only be run by modern liberal values. But right now, I would say it's a mixed bag. I don't think there's a strict distinction, particularly between Nepali Congress and CPN-UML*. They have nationwide networks and do well throughout the country. In terms of Maoists, during the civil war, their main support came from the marginalized Hill communities. But even now, since they came into mainstream politics—it's been nearly two decades—they are indistinguishable from the other two political parties. People say there's absolutely no difference between these parties. They look similar, they sound similar, their leaders sound similar, and the same three leaders of these parties take turns as government head. There's no material or significant difference in their ideology or what they do. Maybe there's a big difference in what they espouse, but in terms of their practice, there's absolutely no difference between these three main political parties. Tushar: How would you evaluate their performance since 2008 in terms of delivering what the Nepali people expected of them? When the Constitution was formed, there were three founding principles: federalism, republicanism, and secularism. Was there an economic promise, or a promise to deliver certain growth? To what extent are the Nepali people satisfied that these three parties, in their different alliances and times in power, have delivered on those promises? Biswas Baral: I think Nepali people have been not at all satisfied. What we see post-2008 is that the monarchy was removed, but there's a popular saying that we removed one monarchy and now we have produced ten monarchs. All the political parties and political leaders are acting as owners. What happened is that the Nepali Congress, CPN-UML*, and the Maoists have basically come to power, and their leaders have become prime ministers by turn. It's purely person-centric politics. The government doesn't change because of ideology or because certain ideology wins in the elections. It's purely person-centric politics: How do I get to power? How do I monopolize it? How do I get to power and make enough money, develop enough resources, so that I can do even better in the next election? How do I distribute important government portfolios so that I can form a base which supports me at all times? Corruption is very high at all levels among the bureaucracy, in politics, and in political parties. When people see this, they question why they overthrew the monarchy because they thought the king was acting entitled and was jailing leaders. How are these leaders any different from him? Some are wondering if they made a mistake by throwing out the monarchy. This has given rise to some new political parties, for instance, the Rastriya Swatantra Party*, which emerged in the 2022 election with around 21-22 seats. Largely, the votes they got were a reflection of the unpopularity of the three main political parties. That said, the vast majority of parliament, both national and federal, are occupied by members from the two largest parties, with some filled by the Maoists. Other parties are still distant to these three parties, including the new ones. Tushar: I asked this question to establish context for our next question about the rise of Hindu politics, because I wonder to what extent this dissatisfaction with the current state of affairs is leading to this revival of Hindu politics. To what extent does the former king continue to have political support and influence in Nepal - are there sections of the population that want the monarchy restored? Is the rise of Hindu politics solely linked to the idea of restoration of the monarchy, or are there other factors behind this phenomenon? Biswas Baral: Like I said, people do not want the same three leaders. It's not even the three parties, but the three leaders who take turns to become Prime Minister. They are sick and tired of seeing the same faces come to power again and again, and they want change. Some opted for the new political party, the Rastriya Swatantra Party*. Some opted for independent candidates. But it's very curious and interesting because if you look at the two most recent general elections, first in 2017 and then in 2022, nearly 95% of the seats in the most recent election went to pro-republican forces or those who don't support monarchy. In the election, just 5% of the votes went to avowedly pro-monarchy parties. If that is the barometer, then monarchy still has very little support. Another thing is that even if you look at the most recent pro-monarchy protests, there are not that many people—2,000, 3,000, maximum 5,000. Whereas at the height of the anti-monarchy protests in 2006, which removed monarchy, there were easily up to a million people coming out in the streets. You don't see that level of support. It seems that monarchy has a lot of support on social media or online to international observers, but when it comes to people coming out on the ground, you don't see that kind of support. There's a mismatch between what we're seeing. This year, there were student elections, and the pro-monarchy parties were absolutely nowhere in the scene. So where is the support for monarchy? How do we calculate the support? Is it the number of people coming out in the streets? Not many people are coming out. Is it the votes they're getting? They're just getting 5% of the votes. It seems that people are dissatisfied with the current political setup and current political parties, but they don't trust the monarchy as yet. They don't think the future of the country lies with monarchy. There is some nostalgia about monarchy among youngsters, particularly those who came of age after it was removed, but this nostalgia is not translated into support in terms of protesting or voting in favor of monarchy. To international observers, it looks like monarchy is on the brink of coming back, but that's not happening. Tushar: I'm reminded of the rise of the BJP in the 1980s in India and how they piggybacked on an issue—the Ram Janmabhoomi* issue and eventually the Babri Masjid* destruction—that catapulted them to power in the 1990s. What issues do Hindu political parties in Nepal campaign on - are there specific social or economic issues? Is the king involved in this at all - has he become a rallying figure of sorts? Biswas Baral: The king's involvement could clearly be seen in the most recent pro-monarchy protests, which unfortunately turned violent. In one protest, two people were killed. The problem was that if the king has new supporters and his support base is growing, then he should have relied on new faces to lead the movement. But who's leading the pro-monarchy movement this time? It's all old faces. The commander of the movement was about 80 years old. These are all old faces at the forefront of recent pro-monarchy protests. When you talk about the factors fuelling the rise of pro-monarchy parties, there's just one pro-monarchy party that has any kind of presence in Nepal. It's the fifth-largest force in parliament, but even that is small—like I said, 5% of the total votes. When you're saying rise of pro-monarchy parties, what does that actually mean? You don't see that in the elections. I don't know what will happen in the next election, but even in by-elections after 2022, no pro-monarchy party is anywhere in the scene. Again, my question is: How do you judge the popularity of monarchy? How do you say that monarchy is gaining more and more support? Yes, you see that on social media, but is that translated on the street? No. Is that translated in the ballot box? No, at least not until now. Right now, this campaign for the restoration of monarchy, even in the last month, is dying down. It's not picking up steam at all. Tushar: Maybe we can broaden from the pro-monarchy specifically to Hindu politics generally. To what extent is a rise in Hindu politics influenced or linked to the rise in Hindutva* ideas and the BJP that we're seeing on the other side of the border in India? Biswas Baral: When we talk about Hindu politics, it's very interesting because two of our three big parties are communist parties. Their leaders are supposedly atheists who don't believe in any religion. But what has happened is that since the rise of the BJP in India, when the political parties and political leaders here saw the allure of Hinduism and a Hindu agenda in India, they suddenly started visiting temples—even communist parties, even the leader of the Maoist party who went to war to establish a secular republic. Nearly 17,000 people died in the process to establish a secular republic, and now they want to be seen as not atheist. They want to be seen by India, particularly, that they believe in Hindu religion. This happens because it's very difficult, given our geopolitics and our precarious situation whereby we are surrounded on three sides by India, and given our large dependence on India trade-wise, for a Nepali Prime Minister to operate and continue in office for any length of time without some support from New Delhi. New Delhi has a lot of leverage in Kathmandu*. Even for that purpose, even the supposedly atheist leaders show off by going to Pashupatinath* or even Indian temples. Even Prachanda*, the leader of the Maoists, when he goes to India, visits temples there. In a way, they have all adopted this approach. The Nepali Congress, the biggest political party, has always had a very ambivalent stand on Hinduism. There's a strong pro-Hindu voice inside the party, and there's a strong Hindu voice in all the major political parties. The support for the restoration of a Hindu state is much bigger than the support for the restoration of monarchy. Those two are not synonymous because support for one is clearly more than support for the other. Coming back to the BJP, I don't think the BJP is directly involved in what's happening. It's more the RSS itself, which has branches in Nepal and supports various pro-monarchy activities in Nepal. That is much more active. Another thing is that we have an open border, so whatever politics is happening in Bihar* or Uttar Pradesh* easily spills over into Nepal. What we see, at least in the Tarai* Belt adjoining India, which is nearly a third of Nepal's territory, is that there has been a shift in terms of visibility of religion. The Hindus suddenly feel they need to show off their religion. They need to go out on streets and organize big rallies. Earlier, you didn't see that. Earlier, the kind of Hinduism practiced in Nepal was done inside the puja ghar*, the small room in your house. They didn't feel the need to go out and assert themselves. That is a very troubling sign because, for the first time in our history, there have been reports of Hindu-Muslim clashes from some of the areas bordering India. We find this extremely troubling. Our political leaders especially make a show of being religious, being Hindu, to please certain constituencies in India. There is a level of support for a Hindu state because many people believe that Nepal was declared a secular republic at the behest of Westerners because they wanted to spread Christianity. Christianity has spread very rapidly in the past, and that only adds to the argument. There is some influence from what's happening in India, and I also see the possibility of this Hindu state agenda gaining ground among the mainstream political parties. They somehow feel that the pro-monarchy party, like the Rastriya Prajatantra Party*, is bidding for public support through their pro-Hindu agenda—not just pro-monarchy, but also pro-Hindu state. Many in the mainstream political parties are thinking they need to attract this sizable conservative constituency, or if it gets out of hand, they'll suffer electorally. So there's a debate in all the political parties about whether they should embrace a Hindu state. One very curious thing I must add is that Nepal is a secular republic right now, but we have a very curious definition of secularism. Even our constitution states that Nepal is a secular republic, but all the ancient cultures and all the religions that have been practiced from ancient times, Sanatan Dharma*, will be preserved. Many people say we are already a de facto Hindu state because conversion is prohibited. Our constitution prohibits conversion, so it's a criminal offense. Many people are saying we are already a de facto Hindu state, so what's the harm in now officially adopting a Hindu state? On the other hand, critics say we are already giving priority to our traditions and cultures, we are protecting Sanatan Dharma*, so what's the need to now declare a Hindu state? Many people are not aware that our definition of secularism is very qualified. Tushar: It's interesting how secularism as it manifests in South Asia differs from the traditional Western conception, or the French conception of laïcité*, where the state separates itself completely from all religions. I do want to ask about the foreign policy implications of this, starting from Nepal's largest trading partner and big neighbour, India. India and Nepal have had a mixed relationship at best. In 2015, we saw the devastating blockade that happened in the Tarai* region of Nepal, and I think India cooperated in blockading Nepal, which strained relations considerably. I wonder how this rise of Hindu politics interacts with nationalistic sentiments within Nepal that perhaps may be directed against India. Are we seeing a more positive relationship or feeling towards India because of this rise of Hindu politics? Biswas Baral: I would say the general perception of Nepalese towards India is not influenced by Hinduism or any other religion. Historically, Nepalese think of themselves as the only state in South Asia that has never been colonized, unlike India. So we are a very proud people. Another thing is that, being surrounded by India on three sides and being so dependent on India for everything, we feel this need to assert ourselves, otherwise we'll be lost. A sense of this Nepaliness, at least among the people of the Hills especially, comes from being not Indian. Even our founder, Prithvi Narayan Shah*, defined Nepal as the Asli Hindustan*—the real home of Hindus—by which he meant that India is not the real Hindustan*. Even in religious matters and cultural matters, the Nepali psyche and mentality is to differentiate ourselves from India. For instance, the current Prime Minister claims that Lord Ram* was not born in India but was born in Nepal. They are looking to appropriate Indian religion because they want to show that we are the true cradle of Hinduism, not India. Another thing is that in 2015, one big reason for the blockade was that India did not want Nepal to become a secular state, which has been borne out by later books and scholarly works of various organizations and individuals who were active at the time. After Nepal became a secular state, I don't think the BJP as a political party itself is so interested in turning Nepal back into a Hindu state. It's much more organizations like the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh* (RSS), which is very active here. This rise of Hindu politics would not have much effect on our relations with India and similarly would not have much effect on our relations with China. Many Nepalese, practicing Hindus and devout Hindus, are perfectly happy with the idea of cultivating the Chinese as a counterweight to India. Even if we have similar religion, similar traditions and cultures, there's this need to assert the Nepali identity—a very strong need to assert the Nepali identity. Historical factors and cultural factors that go much beyond religion are responsible for Nepal-India ties. For instance, we have an open border, people marry across the border. It's a very multifaceted relationship, and I don't think Hindu politics will have very limited impact, even when it comes to pro-monarchy politics. No political party in Nepal can come to power and be anti-Indian. That's just not possible because India will find a way to punish it. We have seen that historically too. A government that is overtly anti-India—for instance, the first government of Prachanda* when he came above ground and his political party emerged the biggest in the 2008 election—he had formed the government, but he took such a strong anti-India line that India played an instrumental role in removing him from power. There were other secondary issues, but without India's backing, he would not have been removed. Even the current political leader, for instance, K.P. Sharma Oli*, is known as China's man in New Delhi, but even he has been trying very hard in the last few years to reach out to India. He has been trying very hard to get an official invite to India, which has not been possible to date, but I hear that he could be visiting India soon. Tushar: That's fascinating, and I was particularly interested in the part where the RSS is influencing cultural activities. Could you maybe just explain very briefly how the RSS is doing this? Biswas Baral: The RSS has branches in Nepal, especially in the Tarai*. It supports religious activities here and has also played some role in making Hinduism, the brand of Hinduism, more like what Hindutva* is doing in India. Given our cultural similarities, the RSS finds it very easy to operate in Nepal, especially in the Tarai* Belt, which adjoins India. It continues to play a very subtle, very behind-the-scenes, but very important role in the so-called preservation of Hindu culture and tradition and in opposing proselytization and Christianization in Nepal. Tushar: Biswas, thank you so much. That was a very interesting interview. Biswas Baral: Amazing talking to you. Thank you for having me.

EU entities covered by the AML framework are required to apply enhanced vigilance in transactions involving these countries. This is important to protect the EU financial system.\n\nA number of third-country jurisdictions were added to the list (Algeria, Angola, Côte d’Ivoire, Kenya, Laos, Lebanon, Monaco, Namibia, Nepal and Venezuela), while other jurisdictions were delisted (Barbados, Gibraltar, Jamaica, Panama, the Philippines, Senegal, Uganda, and the United Arab Emirates).\n\nThe updated list takes into account the work of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and in particular its list of “Jurisdictions under Increased Monitoring”. As a founding member of FATF, the Commission is closely involved in monitoring the progress of the listed jurisdictions, helping them to fully implement their respective action plans agreed with FAFT. Alignment with FATF is important for upholding the EU´s commitment to promoting and implementing global standards.\n\nThe Commission has carefully considered the concerns expressed regarding its previous proposal and conducted a thorough technical assessment, based on specific criteria and a well-defined methodology, invcorporating information collected through the FATF, bilateral dialogues and on-site isits to the jurisdictions in question.\n\nArticle 9 of the 4th Anti-money Laundering Directive (4AMLD) mandates the Commission to regularly update the list of high-risk third-country jurisdictions.

    "content": "New Delhi: The controversy surrounding the presence of alleged foreign nationals in Bihar’s electoral rolls has escalated into a bitter political clash, with BJP leader Sanjay Jaiswal launching a scathing attack on RJD’s Tejashwi Yadav. The issue emerged amid the Election Commission’s ongoing Special Intensive Revision (SIR) exercise, which has now become a flashpoint between the ruling and opposition parties in the state.Reacting strongly to Tejashwi Yadav’s dismissal of reports about foreign nationals being found on the voter list, Jaiswal accused the RJD leader of being uneducated and irresponsible.“Only Tejashwi Yadav can make such comments about media personnel or any human being in general,” Jaiswal told ANI. “The problem with Tejashwi Yadav is that he is not educated, which is why the people at his home make him memorise whatever they want, and he just repeats it. But if someone asks him a question outside of that, he will create this kind of mess.”Demanding a public apology, Jaiswal further said, “Tejashwi Yadav should publicly apologise, express regret, and take an oath that he will not say anything beyond what he is taught at home.”#WATCH | Bettiah, Bihar: On the statement of Bihar Legislative Assembly LoP RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav, BJP leader Sanjay Jaiswal says, ...Only Tejashwi Yadav can make such comments about media personnel or any human being in general. The problem with Tejashwi Yadav is that he… pic.twitter.com/5Et1YHLiHb— ANI (@ANI) July 13, 2025The verbal duel intensified after Tejashwi ridiculed reports that Bangladeshi, Nepali, and even Myanmar nationals were listed as voters in Bihar.Who are these sources? Tejashwi asked, mocking the authenticity of the claims. “These are the same sources that said Islamabad, Karachi, and Lahore have been captured.”He further added sarcastically, “Ye sootra ko hum mootra samajhte hai.”… pic.twitter.com/ACwApxQwVr— Tejashwi Yadav (@yadavtejashwi) July 13, 2025Tejashwi also raised questions about the timing and motivation behind the SIR exercise. “SIR was conducted for the last time in 2003 under the UPA government. Since then, we have seen many elections, including the ones in 2014, 2019, and 2024. In those elections, we lost by three to four lakhs. Does that mean all these foreigners voted for PM Modi? This means that the NDA are at fault for any dubious elements names getting added to the voter lists.”Accusing the process of being politically driven, he said, “That means all the elections they have won have been a fraud... SIR is a complete eyewash. The EC is working as a cell of a political party.”Earlier, a report by news agency IANS quoted Election Commission officials as saying that their field-level teams had identified a “large number” of suspected foreign nationals, mainly from Nepal, Bangladesh, and Myanmar, during the ongoing voter list verification.With Bihar heading into assembly elections later this year, the controversy over the SIR drive and its findings has assumed significant political importance. The process, aimed at cleaning up the electoral rolls, may also influence a broader national conversation on voter roll verification, particularly with an emphasis on individuals’ place of birth.",

He joined the IFS in 1984 and was the youngest in his batch. He has been described by his peers as “no nonsense” and “sharp”.\nHe graduated from Delhi University’s St. Stephen’s College. He published papers on economic diplomacy, Indian diaspora, conflict prevention, and India-Bangladesh relations. He has also published op-eds in outlets such as The New York Times.\nBefore diplomatic service, he worked briefly in India’s corporate and public sectors.\nHe served as an Ambassador to Thailand (from 2014 to 2016), High Commissioner to Bangladesh (from 2016 to 2019), and then as Ambassador to the United States (from January 2019 to January 2020).\nHe served as the 33rd Foreign Secretary from January 29, 2020, to April 30, 2022.\nHe also served as the Chief Coordinator during India’s Presidency of the G20 Summit in 2023.

He also led the UN Political and SAARC divisions, and earlier handled Nepal, Bhutan, and Western Europe affairs.\nAs Ambassador in the US, he was the man behind organising the biggest event of Prime Minister Narendra Modi with Indian-Americans in the country – Howdy Modi – in which President Donald Trump had also participated. Though the event was organised by Texas India Forum, it had been in close coordination with the Indian Embassy in Washington, then led by Shringla.\n\nPM Modi lauded his nomination to the Rajya Sabha and said his perspectives will enrich Parliamentary proceedings.\n“Shri Harsh Vardhan Shringla Ji has excelled as a diplomat, intellectual and strategic thinker. Over the years, he’s made key contributions to India’s foreign policy and also contributed to our G20 Presidency. Glad that he’s been nominated to the Rajya Sabha by President of India. His unique perspectives will greatly enrich Parliamentary proceedings,” he tweeted.",

    "content": "Panama regains “international trust” after being removed from the European Union (EU) money laundering list. Former President Ricardo Martinelli, above right, attributed Panama’s removal from the European Union’s list of high-risk jurisdictions to the work done by the current government. “This is an achievement of this government that cared about the country’s image, not like the previous ones, run by two inept morons who only went to steal and increase the foreign debt, to enrich themselves and destroy the political system and end social peace,” wrote Martinelli on his X account. \n\nFor his part, lawyer Adolfo Linares agrees that previous administrations did not address the issue firmly. According to the lawyer, Panama should never have been on this list. “A large part of why we stayed there from the beginning was due to the pusillanimous, subservient, cowardly, and irresponsible attitude of the Juan Carlos Varela (above left) and Nito Cortizo (above right) governments in particular,” he told Panamá en Directo. Linares noted that these lists are political, not technical, so much so that it’s easy to enter individually, but to exit; you have to vote as a bloc. “It’s an achievement, a big step,” the lawyer reflected.\n\nOpening Opportunities\n\nThe government said Wednesday that the country has regained “international confidence” by being removed from the European Union’s (EU) money laundering list, which in turn “opens doors to foreign investment” in the Central American nation. “Today, the European Union voted to remove Panama from its list of high-risk countries. This is recognition of the serious work we are doing as a country.\n\nThanks to the entire government team that worked to restore international trust,” wrote Panamanian President José Raúl Mulino on his X account. In a statement, the Panamanian Foreign Ministry affirmed that “Panama has successfully removed itself from the list of high-risk jurisdictions that present strategic deficiencies in their national regimes to combat money laundering and terrorist financing,” following a vote this Wednesday in the European Parliament that ratified a similar proposal from the EU Commission.\n\nPanama’s President José Raúl Mulino affirmed that Panama will have a new global image after being excluded from the European Union’s list of high-risk jurisdictions for money laundering and terrorist financing. He expressed his gratitude for the efforts of the various stakeholders involved.\n\nU.S. Ambassador Congratulates Panama on its Removal from the EU Money Laundering List\n\nThis significant achievement reflects the hard work Panama has done to combat money laundering, said Kevin Cabrera, pictured above. The United States ambassador to Panama, Kevin Marino Cabrera, congratulated the Central American country on Wednesday for its exclusion from the European Union (EU) money laundering list and highlighted its efforts to “improve the investment climate.” “Congratulations! This significant achievement reflects the hard work that Panama has done to combat money laundering and improve its investment climate,” the US diplomat said on his X account. The Government of Panama said on Wednesday that the country regains “international confidence” by having been excluded from the list drawn up by the EU, which in turn “opens doors to foreign investment” from Europe in the Central American nation. \n\n“Today, the European Union has voted in favor of removing Panama from its list of high-risk countries. It is recognition of the serious work we are doing as a country. Thanks to the entire government team that worked to regain international trust,” wrote Panamanian President José Raúl Mulino on his X account. In a statement, the Panamanian Foreign Ministry stated that “having demonstrated significant technical advances and sustainability, as well as the results of a diplomatic offensive directly before the European Union, the country has finally been recognized in its efforts and has managed to be excluded from the list, an “achievement” that “does justice to the country’s reputation and opens doors to foreign direct investment from Europe.” \n\nThe European Parliament decided this Wednesday not to object to the proposal, presented by the European Commission on June 10, which removes Panama and other jurisdictions from the money laundering list, after the European Parliament had rejected the repertoire that the Community Executive had initially proposed in April 2024. With this update, they are removed from the list, in addition to Panama, Gibraltar, Barbados, Jamaica, the Philippines, Senegal, Uganda, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), while Venezuela, Algeria, Angola, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Laos, Lebanon, Monaco, Namibia, and Nepal will be included. \n\nThis list—different from the list of tax havens compiled by the Council of the European Union—identifies jurisdictions whose regulations do not guarantee an effective fight against money laundering and terrorist financing. This follows a consultation process between the Commission and the jurisdictions analyzed, allowing them to offer commitments to amend their regulations and avoid inclusion in the list. Appearance on the list does not entail sanctions, but it does require European financial institutions and other organizations to apply greater vigilance to operations carried out by entities established in these territories. In October 2023, Panama was excluded from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) grey list due to progress in its fight against money laundering and terrorist financing. Panama has been one of the FATF’s so-called “jurisdictions under enhanced surveillance” since June 2019.",

    "title": "The UAE is no longer a financial risk in Europe’s eyes, here is what that really means",
    "content": "TL;DRDelisted: The EU has formally removed the UAE from its high-risk AML/CFT list after Parliament’s approval.Backstory: The UAE was grey-listed by FATF in 2022 for regulatory gaps, followed by the EU adding it to their high-risk list in 2023.Reforms: Sweeping structural and compliance changes followed, led by top leadership.Impact: Lower compliance hurdles, improved investor confidence, renewed EU trade prospects.Outlook: Vigilance remains key, reforms must be future-proof.In global finance, reputation is everything, and recovery is never accidental.This week, after more than three years of scrutiny, reform, and international diplomatic maneuvering, the European Parliament formally endorsed the removal of the United Arab Emirates from its list of high-risk third countries for money laundering and terrorist financing. It’s a bureaucratic sentence that hides a transformative story, one of ambition, reform, and the shifting geopolitics of trust.The delisting, long awaited and intensely pursued, is more than a stamp of approval. It’s a signal. A nod from Europe that the UAE is no longer seen as a financial blind spot, but as a committed partner in global regulatory efforts, and that matters not just for compliance officers and policymakers, but for investors, traders, and everyday citizens whose livelihoods depend on global finance functioning well, and functioning clean.The decision was welcomed by UAE officials as a validation of the country’s broader financial reform agenda.“The UAE welcomes the European Parliament’s endorsement of the European Commission’s updated list of high-risk third countries for money laundering and terrorist financing. The decision stands as clear, independent recognition of our nation’s unwavering commitment to the highest international standards in combating global financial crime,” said Ahmed bin Ali Al Sayegh, UAE Minister of State, in a statement to Emirates News Agency (WAM).The minister’s statement followed the European Parliament’s approval of the European Commission’s updated list, which formally delisted the UAE along with Barbados, Panama, Senegal and Uganda. At the same time, the EU added Lebanon and nine other jurisdictions: Algeria, Angola, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Laos, Monaco, Namibia, Nepal and Venezuela to its high-risk monitoring list.What Is the FATF and the EU High-Risk list, and why do they matter? The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is an intergovernmental body based in Paris that sets global standards to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and other financial crimes. Established in 1989, it monitors compliance across over 200 jurisdictions and issues guidance that shapes international regulatory policies. One of FATF’s most influential tools is the “grey list”, officially known as jurisdictions under increased monitoring. Countries placed on the list are identified as having strategic deficiencies in their AML/CFT (Anti-Money Laundering/Countering the Financing of Terrorism) systems. Being listed can lead to: Increased scrutiny from global banks Slower, more expensive transactions Reputational damage Reduced investor confidence FATF listings strongly influence the EU’s own high-risk third-country list, which imposes: Enhanced due diligence by EU financial institutions Stricter compliance and verification protocols Delisting signals that a country has taken concrete, measurable steps to improve its financial oversight, as the UAE has done. It restores confidence, unlocks smoother financial flows, and clears a path for stronger economic ties with the EU and beyond.Timeline: From FATF grey list to EU green light (2022–2025) March 2022: The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) places the UAE on its “grey list” of countries under increased monitoring, citing strategic deficiencies in its AML/CFT framework. March 2023: The EU adds the UAE to its list of “high-risk third countries,” triggering enhanced due diligence requirements for EU-based financial institutions engaging with UAE-linked businesses. February 2024: FATF removes the UAE from its grey list, citing demonstrable progress in key compliance areas—investigations, convictions, regulatory tightening, and international cooperation. June 2025: The European Commission proposes removing the UAE from its updated list, while adding Algeria, Angola, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Laos, Lebanon, Monaco, Namibia, Nepal, and Venezuela. July 2025: The European Parliament formally endorses the Commission’s proposal. The UAE is officially removed from the EU high-risk list. Other jurisdictions removed alongside the UAE include: Barbados, Gibraltar, Jamaica, Panama, the Philippines, Senegal, and UgandaWhy was the UAE listed to begin with?The UAE’s meteoric rise as a global finance and trade hub brought opportunity, and exposure. In 2022, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) placed the country on its grey list, citing structural weaknesses in its anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing (AML/CFT) framework. Key concerns included: Under-regulated high-risk sectors: Real estate, gold and precious metals, luxury goods, and corporate service providers had become gateways for illicit financial flows. Weak enforcement: Financial institutions and DNFBPs often failed to meet compliance standards. Prosecutions were limited, and penalties lacked consistency. Gaps in international cooperation: Cross-border data sharing and financial crime investigations were seen as insufficiently robust. At its core, the UAE had built the infrastructure of a global financial powerhouse, but its regulatory systems hadn’t kept pace. FATF’s listing was a call for reform, not a rebuke of ambition.What reforms did the UAE implement?The UAE launched a sweeping reform agenda to address the concerns raised by international watchdogs, with efforts led by Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Minister of Foreign Affairs and brother of President Mohamed bin Zayed. Delisting became a national priority, driving coordinated action across regulatory, judicial and enforcement bodies.The country moved quickly to implement structural reforms and enforce stricter compliance. Major actions included:Adoption of the 2024–2027 national AML/CFT strategy, aligning regulatory goals with FATF standards.Creation of specialized AML/CFT courts to fast-track financial crime prosecutions.Targeted crackdowns: Over Dh339 million in fines were levied on exchange houses, foreign banks, and insurance firms.Real estate, gold, and virtual assets, traditionally vulnerable sectors, faced expanded oversight.Cross-border cooperation surged, including new data-sharing mechanisms between the Ministry of Economy and Dubai Police to track beneficial ownership. a key FATF concern.Technological reforms were embedded into compliance systems, signaling a shift from reactive regulation to predictive enforcement.Increased international cooperation, including information sharing with foreign intelligence and financial agencies. Boosted virtual asset regulation to address risks in crypto markets and decentralized finance. All these led the FATF to finally remove the UAE from its grey list in February 2024, citing its “significant progress” and increased convictions in financial crimes. The EU, whose own list typically mirrors the FATF’s assessments, followed suit a month later with a formal announcement, culminating in this week’s final parliamentary approval.Why the delisting matters, beyond bureaucracyTo the casual observer, being taken off a regulatory list might sound technical. But the downstream effects are very real.Delisting carries both symbolic and tangible benefits for the UAE:1. Lower Compliance Burdens EU-based banks and firms will no longer need to perform enhanced due diligence on Emirati clients and transactions. This reduces administrative costs, document requirements, and potential delays in financial services. 2. Improved Market Confidence Foreign investors, particularly in banking, fintech, and real estate, are likely to see the UAE as a safer, more transparent jurisdiction. The move strengthens the UAE’s case as a trusted global financial hub, especially as it competes regionally with Qatar and Saudi Arabia. 3. Boost to EU-UAE Trade Talks The UAE’s presence on the blacklist had complicated ongoing negotiations over a trade deal with the EU. Delisting clears the way for deeper talks on strategic sectors like renewable energy, artificial intelligence, digital services, and critical raw materials.As Minister Al Sayegh put it, “We look forward to unlocking the full potential of the UAE-EU partnership, fostering closer cooperation, enhanced prosperity and shared security for our regions and peoples.”Caution Beneath the ConfidenceThe UAE’s victory is real, but the pressure is not over. As its financial doors swing wider open and its global credibility rises, so too does the incentive for illicit actors to exploit its systems. That’s the paradox of success: the cleaner your house, the more others will test the windows. This is why Emirati authorities are emphasizing not just compliance, but future-proofing, making sure regulations can evolve with emerging threats, from digital currency laundering to cross-border terror financing. And this is where the UAE’s next challenge lies: not simply avoiding regression, but building a regulatory architecture that is adaptive, anticipatory, and globally interoperable.FAQsQ: What is the FATF? The FATF is a global body that sets standards to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. It monitors countries to ensure they follow these rules and protect the financial system.Q:Why was the UAE put on the FATF grey list? The UAE was listed because of weaknesses in its laws and enforcement, especially in high-risk sectors like real estate and virtual assets, which made it vulnerable to financial crime.Q: What does being on the EU high-risk list mean?It means the EU requires financial institutions to apply stricter checks on transactions involving that country to prevent illicit money flows.Q:How did the UAE improve to get removed from the lists?The UAE implemented stronger laws, created special courts, increased oversight in vulnerable sectors, fined non-compliant firms, and enhanced cooperation with international partners.Q:What does delisting mean for the UAE?Delisting signals restored trust from international regulators, easing financial transactions and boosting investor confidence.Q:Are there risks even after delisting?Yes, the UAE must continue adapting its regulations to address emerging threats like digital currency abuse and evolving financial crimes.Q: Why does this matter to ordinary people?Effective financial controls support a stable economy, protect investments, and promote job growth and business opportunities.",

    "title": "World News | Nepali Lawmakers Demand Cross-border Information Sharing Mechanism with China Following Rasuwa Floods",
    "content": "Kathmandu [Nepal], July 10 (ANI): Nepali lawmakers have demanded a cross-border information sharing mechanism with China following the devastating flood of Tuesday, which till now has claimed nine lives, with 19 still unaccounted for.\nAddressing Wednesday's parliamentary session, lawmakers from both the opposition as well as ruling parties demanded a cross-border sharing mechanism with China as it was absent on Tuesday.\nAlso Read | PM Modi in Namibia: Standing Ovation, 'Modi, Modi' Chant Reverberates As PM Narendra Modi Addresses Namibian Parliament (Watch Video).\n\"In those areas there is absence of proper sirens and presage. In the absence of those, the damages incurred have been the preliminary suspicion. But now in the border areas that Nepal shares with China, glaciers are at risk and can explode at any time, inviting another disaster. Regarding this issue, the Government of Nepal should have serious conversations with the Chinese side, engage in information exchange and take precautions for the possible disasters,\" Madhav Sapkota, lawmaker from the opposition CPN-Maoist Centre said.\nRajendra Bajgain, a lawmaker from the ruling Nepali Congress, also cautioned the government for continued interaction with the Chinese side regarding possible disasters.\nAlso Read | 'India, Africa Must Act Together To Create Future Defined Not by Power and Dominance, but by Partnership and Dialogue', Says PM Narendra Modi While Addressing Joint Session of Namibian Parliament.\n\"The Bhotekoshi flood and glaciers in Tibet and the dams, these issues have been read in the news a lot. We have heard the news that China is building dams, but those who are living downstream- we Nepali were expected to be affected the most and it also has started to follow. It is an issue to be discussed with China through diplomatic channels, I want to drag the attention of Government of Nepal towards it,\" Bajgain said.\nThough China has been alerting the Nepali side over time about heavy rainfall in Tibet, which might trigger flooding in Nepal, no alert was given about Tuesday's possible flooding. As per the preliminary investigation by Nepali authorities, it has been ascertained to be because of permafrost.\nPermafrost refers to terrain made of compacted rock, snow, and soil that remains below 0 degrees Celsius year-round. Even light rainfall or increased temperatures can destabilize it, causing sudden floods or landslides.\nThe preliminary assessment was made by Nepal's Department of Hydrology and Meteorology- supported by satellite imagery, local officials from the border area, and geologists.\nIt is mentioned in the assessment that a section of long-frozen permafrost suddenly gave way near the river's source, which flows into Nepal via Gosainkunda Rural Municipality-1. The document also states that at least four of the river's glacial tributaries originate in Tibet. On the Nepali side, the catchment extends through glacial areas between Langtang Lirung and the Sangbu Ri ridge, reaching as far down as the Dudhkunda Ghattekhola area.\nThe Lhende River joins the Trishuli downstream from the Nepal-China friendship bridge at Rasuwagadhi, which was washed away by the flood.\nOther glacial tributaries, including the Tibu glacier to the northeast, the Purupe glacier further upstream, and another glacier northwest of Langtang Himal, all contribute to the Lhende. These catchments collectively host at least seven glacial lakes on the Tibetan side, and a smaller one can be seen near Dudhkunda in Nepal.\nDue to rising global temperatures, these permafrost areas have been receiving consistent rainfall in recent years. The warm precipitation accelerates the melting of permafrost--frozen mixes of snow, sand, and rock--which have remained stable for decades at subzero temperatures.\nTuesday's flood has affected several local units, including Gosaikunda, Aamachhodingmo, Uttargaya, and Kalika rural municipalities. The flood also disrupted the Pasang Lhamu Highway, with the section from Ghunche to Timure rendered impassable after the road cracked in Gosaikunda Rural Municipality-5.\nAlthough it is suspected that the glacial lake burst and flooded due to floods or landslides, there is no conclusive evidence so far. ICIMOD's 2021 list shows that a glacial lake in the upper part of the Trishuli River in China's Tibetan Autonomous Region has been classified as high-risk. Recent studies have shown that between 1990 and 2020, the size of glacial lakes in the basin increased by 33 percent and the number by 16 percent. Recent satellite images taken before the flooding have also shown an increase in the number of glacial lakes.\n\"Since cloud cover has hampered optical satellite analysis, it is mandatory to wait until the sky clears to verify whether any of these lakes have collapsed or whether there has been a sudden change in the volume of the lake,\" the ICIMOD said in a statement.\nAs per the preliminary analysis by ICIMOD, global and regional weather forecasting systems, including ICIMOD's high-impact weather assessment toolkit, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Global Forecasting System, the European Center's Mid-Range Weather Forecasting, icosahedral non-hydrostatic weather models, as well as nearby real-time satellite rainfall products, do not indicate significant rainfall in Chinese catchments in the upper reaches in the days before the flood. This indicates that excessive rainfall was not the main cause of floods in Bhotekoshi and Trishuli.

    "title": "Nepal Flash Floods Kill 7, Wash Away Key Bridge Near China Border; Dozens Missing Amid Heavy Rains",
    "content": "At least seven people have tragically lost their lives and 18 others remain missing after torrential monsoon rains triggered devastating flash floods along the Bhotekoshi River in Nepal’s Rasuwa district, near the border with China. \n\nThe disaster struck early Tuesday morning, sweeping away the crucial Friendship Bridge at Rasuwagadi, a vital lifeline facilitating trade and transit between the two nations. Rescue operations are underway involving Nepali police, army, and helicopter teams, while authorities warn of ongoing risks due to persistent heavy rains. \n\nThe incident has severely disrupted cross-border trade and left hundreds stranded, highlighting the vulnerability of Himalayan border communities to climate-induced disasters.\n\nBridge Collapse Disrupts Lives and Trade, Rescue Efforts Intensify\n\nThe collapse of the Friendship Bridge—also known locally as the Miteri Bridge—has brought cross-border movement to a standstill. Located about 120 kilometres north of Kathmandu, the bridge serves as a key conduit for goods and people between Nepal and China. \n\nAccording to Arjun Paudel, Chief District Officer of Rasuwa, the floodwaters swept away not only the bridge but also dozens of trucks, hundreds of electric vehicles awaiting customs clearance, and several houses in the area. Among the missing are 12 Nepali citizens, including three police officers, and six Chinese nationals, many of whom were involved in a Chinese-backed infrastructure project nearby. \n\nRescue teams comprising 95 personnel, supported by helicopters, have managed to evacuate over 55 stranded individuals so far, but the search continues amid challenging weather and terrain. Authorities have urged residents living downstream along the Trishuli River to evacuate immediately to avoid further casualties.\n\nMonsoon Fury Exposes Infrastructure Vulnerabilities\n\nThis flash flood was reportedly triggered by intense rainfall in the Tibetan plateau region, which caused the Bhotekoshi River to swell rapidly and overflow. In addition to the bridge’s destruction, large sections of the Pasang Lhamu Highway—Rasuwa’s main road—have been washed away, isolating the district and complicating relief efforts. \n\nThe flood also damaged local hydropower projects, leading to a loss of approximately 200 megawatts of electricity generation capacity, which has resulted in widespread power outages in the region. The customs yard at Rasuwagadi was devastated, with numerous vehicles and containers lost to the floodwaters, further exacerbating the economic impact on Nepal’s fragile trade network. \n\nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli expressed deep sorrow over the loss of life and infrastructure, emphasising the need for urgent investment in climate-resilient infrastructure and improved disaster preparedness in the Himalayan border areas.\n\nThe Logical Indian’s Perspective\n\nThe tragic events unfolding along the Nepal-China border serve as a powerful reminder of the urgent need to balance development with environmental stewardship in the fragile Himalayan ecosystem. The Logical Indian stands firmly for regional cooperation, empathy, and sustainable solutions that prioritise the safety and well-being of border communities. \n\nAs climate change intensifies monsoon patterns and increases the frequency of such disasters, it is imperative that Nepal, China, and neighbouring countries collaborate closely to build resilient infrastructure, improve early warning systems, and foster community preparedness. \n\nWe urge our readers to reflect on how cross-border dialogue and joint action can help mitigate future tragedies. What steps do you think governments and local communities should take to safeguard lives and livelihoods in these vulnerable regions?",

    "title": "Why the MCC’s Continuation is in the Interest of Nepal — and the US",
    "content": "The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), an American bilateral foreign aid agency, has been mired in controversy in Nepal since the get-go. It signed a $500 million compact with Nepal in September 2017. Proposed projects aimed to maintain road quality, increase the availability and reliability of electricity, and facilitate cross-border electricity trade between Nepal and India, which in turn would “spur investments, accelerate economic growth, and reduce poverty.” As part of the deal, besides the $500 million the Americans were giving, Nepal would pitch in $197 million for the completion of the MCC projects. The projects ran into controversy after senior American officials started linking them to the Indo-Pacific Strategy (IPS), an American military construct designed to curtail China’s rise. The common sentiment was that Nepal should not be a part of any military or strategic pact, especially one that harms its relations with China, the large neighbor to the north. Early in 2022, senior American officials like the MCC’s then-Vice President Fatema Z. Sumar and the then-U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Donald Lu threatened Nepal’s political leadership that the failure to ratify the MCC on time could lead to a review of America’s ties with Nepal. The compact’s stipulation that future disputes in the projects would be settled in line with the compact’s provisions -- and not Nepal’s domestic laws -- also irked Nepalis. At the height of the MCC disputes in 2022, Nepali political leaders, especially senior hands in the country’s largest party, the Nepali Congress, strongly backed the MCC projects, even when it was not a popular thing to do. Many left-leaning leaders, too, lent their tacit support to the compact -- provided it was amended before parliamentary ratification. Eventually, a middle way was found: Nepal’s parliament would ratify the compact while also passing an accompanying interpretative declaration. Among other things, the declaration clarified that the compact’s endorsement did not mean Nepal will be “a part of any United States’ strategy, military or security alliance including the Indo-Pacific Strategy.” And in case of disputes, the Constitution of Nepal would prevail over the compact. The ratification came at the end of 2022, and the Americans accepted the interpretative declaration, clearing the way for project implementation. Nepal’s interests had been secured and the country had locked in an advantageous deal. First, the MCC projects would be built on grants, thus creating no additional liability on the Nepali state. Second, its time-bound nature would be a breath of fresh air in a country where vital infrastructure projects tend to be delayed by years or even decades. Third, as the power lines being built with American money would be used to take Nepal’s excess energy to India, it would help Nepal realize its old dream of prospering through the export of its electricity. Then, Donald Trump came to power in January 2025 and declared that all American aid projects, including the MCC, had been put on hold. This created confusion in Nepal as it was unclear whether the funds for Nepal would be exempted. In fact, the common belief was that the Nepal compact was dead and buried -- even though it had been signed during Trump’s first term as U.S. president. Nepal’s liberal-minded politicians had staked their careers and credibility to push for the compact’s ratification—and now the Americans were seemingly backing out. Pulling the plug on the compact would thus have made it difficult for the Nepali political class to endorse any future American project or funding. Amid this uncertainty, in the middle of June, the U.S. Embassy in Kathmandu announced that Nepal had been exempted from budget cuts and the MCC projects were still scheduled for completion by their original August 2028 deadline. The announcement was timely. The projects’ cancellation would have damaged bilateral ties and harmed Nepal’s interests. The U.S. helps balance the oft-overwhelming influence of India and China, Nepal’s two big (and only) neighbors, which is why the U.S. is often called Nepal’s sky or third neighbor. When India blockaded landlocked Nepal in 2015-16, the United States consistently highlighted the resulting hardships of Nepali people, helping build international pressure on India to quickly lift the embargo. Even for the United States, reneging on the compact would have backfired. (It still could if Trump changes his mind again.) If their goal is to check China’s rise in the region, it can only be done by winning the confidence of smaller countries like Nepal and helping them in their development endeavors. The lofty democratic ideals American officials like to emphasize tend to grate when not backed by such solid support. Of late, the U.S. has taken some dubious decisions like the suspension of visa interviews for Nepali students wanting to study in the U.S., and shutting down the USAID that was supporting key health initiatives in Nepal. But the continuity of the MCC projects suggests the Americans are not abandoning Nepal. Even more importantly for Nepalis, the MCC’s presence in Nepal undercuts the foreign policy myth that the U.S. views Nepal through Indian lens.",

    "content": "Binod Chaudhary, Nepal’s only billionaire, commands a vast business empire spanning 136 companies across more than a dozen industries. A business tycoon-turned-politician, Chaudhary is the chairman of Chaudhary Group (CG Corp Global), with interests ranging from banking, hospitality, and consumer goods to energy, education, and healthcare. His net worth is estimated at $1.8 billion, making him a towering figure in South Asia’s business landscape.\nAmong Chaudhary’s most notable brands are ‘Wai Wai’ noodles, which enjoy substantial popularity in India, and Nepal’s Nabil Bank. His company manages a total of 143 hotels, including several 5-star establishments operated in collaboration with India’s Taj Hotels chain.\nBorn into a Marwari business family in Kathmandu, Chaudhary’s heritage traces back to India, with his grandfather migrating from Rajasthan to Nepal. His father established Nepal’s first departmental store. Although Binod Chaudhary was poised to join the family business as the third-generation entrepreneur, he initially aspired to pursue further studies.\nHowever, circumstances led him to abandon his chartered accountancy studies in India due to his father’s heart condition, prompting Binod to take over the family’s business operations.\nIn 1973, Chaudhary inaugurated Nepal’s most iconic disco, followed by introducing Wai Wai noodles to Nepal in 1984. He subsequently forged partnerships with brands like Suzuki and Panasonic. In 1995, he acquired a controlling stake in Nabil Bank from the Dubai government.\nAs of 2023, Chaudhary’s net worth exceeded Rs 14,700 crore ($1.8 billion), according to Forbes. While his wealth is modest compared to global billionaires like Elon Musk, with a net worth of $247 billion, or India’s Mukesh Ambani, who has a net worth of $107.1 billion, Chaudhary remains Nepal’s sole billionaire.\nA Bollywood enthusiast, Chaudhary is particularly fond of Amitabh Bachchan. His inspirations include Indian businessman JRD Tata and South African President Nelson Mandela. As a politician, Chaudhary is a member of Nepal’s Parliament. At 69, he has entrusted the management of his business empire to his three sons, Nirvana, Rahul, and Varun.",

    "content": "Kathmandu [Nepal], July 8 (ANI): Nepal Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli has once again reiterated his claim that Lord Ram was born in Nepal. Addressing a party event in Kathmandu on Monday, the Nepal PM claimed Lord Ram's birthplace lies within Nepal's territory and encouraged people not to shy away from spreading the message.\nSpeaking at a programme organised by his party, CPN-UML's Tourism and Civil Aviation Department, Oli said his claims are based on the original \"Ramayana\" written by sage Balmiki (Valmiki).\"We talk about tourism. But how can someone just make a story about Ram being born somewhere else, specifying the place? Ram was born in Nepal. It is in Nepalese territory; that place now lies in Nepal. I won't say it was Nepal even then. Where was it, where wasn't it? Was it a Tharu village? But now that territory is in Nepal. Ram is God; it is up to you to believe it or not.\nThose who believe Ram is God, Ram's birthplace is sacred. We are not able to preach it much. We don't preach more about it. We don't dare to do so. It feels awkward. I think it's annoying,\" the Prime Minister said.\nThe Prime Minister also claimed that other figures from Hindu mythology are also from Nepal. \"Shiva is from here, Vishwamitra is from here. I am not saying this; it's written in Ramayana, in Balmiki's Ramayana. Vishwamitra says that Ram crossed the Koshi River and went west, and taught Lakshmana.\" Oli added. He suggested that the places mentioned in the epic now lie in Nepal's Sunsari district, stating, \"I didn't write that. It is clear that Vishwamitra is from Chatara.\"\nThis is not the first time Oli has made such statements. In July 2020, he claimed that the ancient Ayodhya lies in Thori, Chitwan, Nepal, and ordered the construction of a Ram temple there. At the time, he had argued that Ram Janmabhoomi rightfully belongs to Nepal and cannot be reassigned by \"creating a story.\"\n\"Balmiki Ashram is in Nepal, and the holy place where King Dasharath had executed the rites to get his son is in Ridi.

Members of the ruling Nepal Communist Party had criticised Oli for making remarks that have a direct link with the religious sentiments and thoughts of people.\nNepal's Foreign Ministry also had to issue a release clarifying the issue, which has been brought to the limelight repeatedly by Oli.

    "title": "‘Not Even Second-Class Citizens, We’re Hostages’: Owaisi Vs Kiren Rijiju On Minority Rights",
    "content": "A sharp exchange unfolded on Monday between AIMIM president Asaduddin Owaisi and Union Minister Kiren Rijiju over the state of minority rights in India, with both leaders taking to social media platform ‘X’ to voice their positions. Owaisi strongly criticised Rijiju’s comment that India is the only nation where minorities enjoy more benefits and protection than the majority, calling such a statement unconstitutional and misleading.\nTaking to ‘X’, the Hyderabad MP wrote, “You are a Minister of the Indian Republic, not a monarch. @KirenRijiju You hold a constitutional post, not a throne. Minority rights are fundamental rights, not charity.”\nOwaisi expressed concern that India’s minorities are no longer treated even as second-class citizens. “India’s minorities are not even second-class citizens anymore. We are hostages,” he alleged.\nThe AIMIM chief also took aim at the Waqf (Amendment) Act passed by the BJP-led government, asking, “Can Muslims be members of Hindu Endowment Boards? No. But your Waqf Amendment Act forces non-Muslims onto Waqf Boards — and allows them to form a majority.”\nFurther accusing the Centre of systemic neglect, Owaisi pointed out that key educational schemes that benefitted Muslim students have been scrapped or restricted. He cited the discontinuation of the Maulana Azad National Fellowship, along with the defunding of the pre-matric scholarship and limitations placed on post-matric and merit-cum-means scholarships.\n“Muslims are now the only group whose numbers have fallen in higher education and their presence in the informal economy has gone up,” he said, alleging that the community had suffered greatly under the government’s economic policies.\nAccording to Owaisi, Muslim-dominated localities remain the most deprived in terms of public infrastructure and essential services. He clarified that the community was not seeking special treatment, but only what is guaranteed by the Constitution: “We are not asking to be compared with other minorities of other countries. We are not asking for more than what the majority community gets. We are demanding what the Constitution promises: social, economic, and political justice.”\nRijiju Responds, Owaisi Hits Back\nResponding to Owaisi’s accusations, Union Minister Kiren Rijiju wrote on ‘X’, “Ok… How come Minorities from our neighbouring countries prefer to come to India & our Minorities don’t migrate? Prime Minister @narendramodi ji’s welfare schemes are for all. The schemes of the Ministry of Minority Affairs provide additional benefits to the Minorities.”\nOwaisi promptly replied with a pointed post. “If we don’t migrate it means we are happy. Actually, we are not in the habit of fleeing: we did not run away from the British, we did not run away during partition, and we did not run away because of Jammu, Nellie, Gujarat, Moradabad, Delhi etc massacres. Our history is proof that we neither collaborate with our oppressors nor do we hide from them. We know how to fight for our democratic rights and we will inshallah. Stop comparing our great nation with failed states like Pakistan, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Nepal & Sri Lanka. Jai Hind, Jai Samvidhan!”\nBJP, Congress Leaders Also Weigh In\nBJP spokesperson Syed Zafar Islam, speaking to PTI, criticised Owaisi for allegedly misrepresenting the government’s intent. \nVIDEO | AIMIM president Asaduddin Owaisi, Union Minister Kiren Rijiju engage in war of words on social media over minorities rights.

This has uplifted the Muslim community. However, people like Asaduddin Owaisi keep instigating the Muslims. Because of people like him, the entire Muslim community gets defamed,” he said.\nCongress leader Rajendra Kumar Singh also said, \"In India, the makers of the Constitution and freedom fighters have framed the basic structure of democracy, and it includes various organisations which are independently doing their work. But there is democracy just for namesake in our neighbouring countries, forcing minorities to come here. Our borders are also porous and it is difficult to stop infiltration.\"\nSpeaking to news agency ANI, Congress leader Danish Ali echoed Owaisi's remarks as he said, \"Everyone knows that ever since Narendra Modi has formed the government, what is happening with the minorities on roads and in Parliament is not hidden from anyone.\"\n#WATCH | Delhi: On AIMIM Chief Asaduddin Owaisi’s statement on Union Minorities Minister Kiren Rijiju, Congress leader Danish Ali says, \"Everyone knows that ever since Narendra Modi has formed the government, what is happening with the minorities on roads and in Parliament, is… pic.twitter.com/O40KzJL4Oy\n— ANI (@ANI) July 7, 2025\n\"This government acts as a prosecutor, a judge, and an implementing agency, all in one.

    "content": "Hundreds of supporters gathered outside the residence of Nepal’s former king Gyanendra Shah on Monday to mark his 78th birthday, in a growing show of support for the monarchy, more than 15 years after it was abolished.\nWaving flags, holding banners, and offering traditional gifts and flowers, royal well-wishers lined the streets near Shah’s private home in Kathmandu. Many chanted slogans calling for the return of the monarchy, expressing frustration with the country’s political system.\n“I am thankful to everyone who came,” Shah said in a brief address, dressed in a brown suit jacket and traditional Nepali hat, as his grandchildren stood beside him.\n\nPeople gathering at Nirmal Niwas on the occasion of Gyanendra Shah’s birthday. ? pic.twitter.com/nXiB5YdHuP\n— Routine of Nepal banda (@RONBupdates) July 7, 2025\n\nNepal abolished its 240-year-old monarchy in 2008 following a decade-long Maoist insurgency and mass street protests. Gyanendra Shah, who ascended the throne in 2001 after the palace massacre that killed King Birendra and much of the royal family, was the last king of Nepal.\nShah ruled as a constitutional monarch until 2005, when he seized absolute power, dismissed parliament, and imposed emergency rule. This led to widespread protests, which eventually forced him to step down and paved the way for a republic.\nSupport for the monarchy has resurged in recent years, driven by public dissatisfaction over political instability, corruption, and the slow pace of development. Nepal has had frequent changes in government since becoming a republic, and many citizens say they feel let down by political leaders.\n“We need a king because it was the monarchy that first unified Nepal,” said Prajuna Shrestha, a 33-year-old businesswoman. “If we look at the current situation, politics has deteriorated, and the politicians have ruined our country.”\nFormer state worker Kula Prasad Bhattarai, who waited in line for hours to meet the king, said the removal of the monarchy had not brought the expected changes. “People were looking for change and they removed the king hoping that it would be beneficial for the country, but that was very untrue and the political parties repeatedly betrayed people’s trust,” he said.\nThe former king, who rarely makes public statements, has recently made several appearances and allowed well-wishers to visit his home for three hours on his birthday.\nThough Gyanendra has shown no clear intention to reclaim power, royalist rallies have drawn large crowds across Nepal in recent months. In May, tens of thousands marched demanding his return. A similar protest in March turned violent, leading to two deaths and clashes with police.\n(With inputs from agencies)",

    "content": "New Delhi [India], July 7: BAAGH: Tiger - The Inside Story, a powerful new novel that merges wildlife crime, suspense, and an urgent conservation message, is now available on all major platforms. Set against the expansive and untamed wilderness of India and the Himalayas, BAAGH offers a visceral glimpse into the murky world of illegal tiger trafficking--today the third-largest illicit trade in the world.\nAlso Read | Celebi Aviation Security Revocation: Delhi High Court Upholds BCAS Order Invalidating Security Clearance of Turkish Firm Due to National Security Reasons.\nThe novel traces the journey of Jaggu, a Bavaria tribesman from central India, born into a lineage of notorious poachers. Caught between his violent ancestral past and an evolving reverence for the forest, Jaggu's story is one of redemption, grit, and inner conflict. His journey--spanning Deccan's dusty trails to the snow-laden Himalayan passes--follows the contraband trail of a poached tigress, bringing to light the emotional, spiritual, and ecological costs of wildlife crimes.\nPraised as \"real and raw\" by Bollywood actor Jackie Shroff, the novel goes beyond entertainment, serving as a \"clarion call for conservation.\" From nail-biting chases through Kathmandu to encounters with Yak caravans in Tibet, the story not only thrills but immerses readers in the forest's language, rhythm, and politics. Dr. Rajesh Gopal, Secretary General of the Global Tiger Forum, lauds the novel as \"The Jungle Book of today--redefined by modern challenges of poverty, encroachment, and poaching.\"\nAlso Read | Highest Test Match Aggregates for Batter, From Shubman Gill to Wiaan Mulder; Check Full List.\nThe book's realism and emotional weight are rooted in the life experiences of its author, Abhishek Ray. Known to many as a national award-winning composer behind soundtracks of critically acclaimed films like Paan Singh Tomar and I Am Kalam, Ray is also a government-certified tiger tracker and wildlife conservationist. He is the creator of the Sitabani Wildlife Reserve, a rewilded hill once barren, now home to thriving species.\nRay brings this rare authenticity to BAAGH, crafting a protagonist that reflects his own journey into the wild. Sonu Nigam, who trekked with Ray in the Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve, writes in the book's preface, \"Be prepared for a vivid, dramatic trek through thrilling storytelling, drenched in truth and fact-finding.\"\nThe novel has received endorsements from some of India's most respected voices in conservation and music. IBCA Director General S.P. Yadav called the book \"a spiritual message for humanity\", while singers like Shaan and Kavita Krishnamurthi have praised the emotional depth and cinematic prose.\nGoogle Books describes it aptly: \"An intriguing story encompassing wildlife, crime, action, adventure, and contraband, Baagh reflects the tiger's fight for survival against all odds in today's human-dominated landscape.\"\nAt its heart, BAAGH is not just a tale of survival but a powerful invitation to rethink humanity's relationship with nature. The novel is dedicated to the wild tigers and leopards that have crossed paths with Ray during his solitary treks--those that, as he poetically states, \"looked me in the eye and decided to spare my life so that I could write their inside story.\"\nFor more information or to purchase the book, visit:BAAGH on Google Books\n(ADVERTORIAL DISCLAIMER: The above press release has been provided by VMPL.

These reforms allowed students to receive residence permits for the full duration of their studies rather than renewing annually, and expanded their rights to work as they study.\n\nAccording to Migri's Director of Development, Johannes Hirvelä, the reforms have attracted a different profile of students — often slightly older and more likely to bring family members. Students are permitted to bring spouses and minor children.\n\nToday, most degree-seeking students from outside the EU arrive from countries such as Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, China, India, Pakistan, Vietnam, Nigeria, Myanmar, and Russia. Hirvelä noted that Finnish authorities have not actively marketed the changes, but suggested that the information has clearly reached potential applicants.\n\nFinancial difficulties come to light\n\nAs the number of student families grows, so too have concerns about financial hardship. In Tampere, one-third of those requesting food aid are now international students. Authorities had already begun noticing problems before they became a topic of public discussion, with reports coming in from social workers, churches, and NGOs.\n\nHirvelä said some students arrive with unrealistic expectations about their employment prospects, often influenced by misleading claims from intermediary firms.\n\nUnder the current system, a student's financial situation is only verified in the first year, even if their permit covers the entire study period. Family members, however, must apply for renewed permits annually, which includes a reassessment of household finances.\n\nAlthough international students are not eligible for Finnish study grants and must pay tuition, only a small number apply for social assistance — which could jeopardise their residence permits.\n\nGovernment plans for policy overhaul\n\nIn light of these developments, Prime Minister Petteri Orpo's (NCP) government has signalled its intention to tighten residence permit conditions. In April, it pledged to work with universities to pre-empt financial difficulties and crack down on misleading marketing.\n\nA broader review will assess challenges related to students’ and their families’ livelihoods, potential abuse of the permit system, and national security concerns. Decisions on possible adjustments are expected by the end of the year.\n\nHirvelä supports the review, saying it is important to ensure the system still serves its intended purpose.\n\n\"It's undoubtedly appropriate to evaluate whether corrective actions are needed,\" he said. \"What matters is that no one ends up in Finland without resources and in a vulnerable position.\"\n\nInterior minister wants to reverse the reform\n\nInterior Minister Mari Rantanen (Finns) has called for a full reversal of the 2022 reforms.\n\n\"This has played out exactly as we warned in Parliament,\" Rantanen said, referring to financial problems and alleged abuses.\n\nShe wants to return to the previous system, which required more frequent proof of financial self-sufficiency, and to apply the same strict criteria for student family reunification as for other migrants.\n\nWhen asked whether the number of non-EU students should be capped, Rantanen did not call for outright restrictions but said Finland must assess whom it can afford to educate.\n\n\"There's probably no issue with those who enter established study programmes, can support themselves, and don’t necessarily bring their entire family for the full duration of their studies,\" she noted.",

    "title": "Crowds Celebrate Nepal Ex-king's Birthday In Show Of Support",
    "content": "Hundreds of well-wishers lined up outside the home of Nepal's deposed king to celebrate his 78th birthday on Monday, the latest pro-monarchy show of support in the Himalayan republic.Gyanendra Shah, the last king of Nepal, was deposed in 2008 at the end of a decade-long civil war.\"I am thankful to everyone who came,\" Shah said in a brief address to the crowd, dressed in a brown suit jacket and sporting a traditional Nepali cloth hat.In the past year, public support for the restoration of the monarchy has grown -- in tandem with dissatisfaction over political instability, corruption and slow economic development in the country of 30 million people.Waving flags and carrying banners, supporters lined the streets near Shah's residence, some honking traditional trumpets and thumping drums.Nepal's royal palace in the capital Kathmandu is now a museum, and Shah's home is a sprawling estate fortified with high walls.\"I wish him a long life, and hope to see monarchy return soon,\" Prajuna Shrestha, a 33-year-old businesswoman, told AFP.Shah accepted flowers and traditional offerings as his grandchildren stood behind him.Nepal's Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, 73, began his fourth term last year after his Communist Party forged a coalition government with the centre-left Nepali Congress in the often-volatile parliament.\"We need a king because it was the monarchy that first unified Nepal,\" Shrestha added. \"If we look at the current situation, politics has deteriorated, and the politicians have ruined our country.\"Shah was crowned in 2001 after his elder brother king Birendra Bir Bikram Shah and his family were killed in a palace massacre.His coronation took place as a Maoist insurgency was raging in far-flung corners of Nepal.Shah suspended the constitution and dissolved parliament in 2005, triggering a democratic uprising in which the Maoists sided with Nepal's political establishment to orchestrate huge street protests.That eventually precipitated the end of the conflict, with parliament voting in 2008 to abolish Nepal's 240-year-old Hindu monarchy.Abdicated king Shah had largely refrained from commenting on Nepal's fractious politics, but has recently made several public appearances with supporters.According to the World Bank, Nepal is currently facing multiple challenges, with more than 80 percent of the workforce in informal employment.The bank also notes however, that real GDP grew by 4.9 percent in the first half of the 2025 financial year -- up from 4.3 percent in the same period a year earlier -- primarily due to a \"pickup in agricultural and industrial sectors\".Headline inflation over the same period also eased to five percent, down from 6.5 percent the year before",

    "title": "Voter rolls revision is legal, moral and essential. So, what's the problem?",
    "content": "Demography is destiny, and dozens of districts in India have already seen their destiny being shaped by those who aren't Indians. It is through elections that a nation shapes its politics and policy, and it is only fair that only genuine citizens get to decide on the course the country takes. For this, intensive scrutiny of electoral rolls, from time to time, is a must.Article 326 of the Constitution ensures every Indian above the age of 18 shall be entitled to be registered as a voter, but the fundamental precondition is that the person has to be an Indian citizen. The Election Commission (EC) says it \"has a constitutional obligation to ensure that only persons who are citizens\" get to vote.To ensure that, the EC needs to conduct intensive revisions of electoral rolls at regular intervals.However, the recent political fireworks were sparked by the EC's announcement that it was starting a special intensive revision (SIR) of the electoral rolls in Bihar.The intensive revision of electoral rolls is planned as a pan-India exercise and starts with Bihar, the state to go to the polls next.On July 3, 11 INDIA bloc parties met Election Commission (EC) officials and raised concerns over the timing of the exercise. They alleged that over two crore voters of Bihar might get disenfranchised because they won't be able to provide the documents sought by the EC.On July 06, the EC made it clear that while voters were required to \"submit their documents anytime before July 25, 2025\", those who failed to do so would get an opportunity \"during the claims and objections period\". The enumeration form has to be submitted to the Booth Level Officer (BLO).The EC said in a statement on July 6 that 77,895 BLOs were involved in the house-to-house exercise, helping voters fill out enumeration forms, and collecting them.A revision of electoral rolls is an essential, legal and moral exercise, and was last conducted 20 years ago. Since then, only summary revision of electoral rolls has taken place. Section 16 of the Representation of the People Act, 1950, also states that only Indian citizens are entitled to be registered on the electoral roll. (PTI Image for representation) With the special intensive revison, the EC intends to hold rigorous door-to-door surveys and weed out illegal immigrants who might have surreptitiously sneaked in into the voters' list.India has 20 million Bangladeshi illegal immigrants, Kiren Rijiju, then junior Home Minister, told Parliament in 2016.WHY SPECIAL INTENSIVE REVISION OF ELECTORAL ROLLS MATTERS FOR BIHARBihar, other than states like Assam, West Bengal and Jharkhand, is reported to have witnessed large-scale illegal immigration, especially from Bangladesh.Parts of Bihar, especially the Seemanchal region -- adjoining Bengal and Nepal -- are said to have seen an asymmetric growth in population. The region with four districts is not far from the Siliguri Corridor or Chicken's Neck, where Bangladesh territory juts in.\"The [Seemanchal] region, which is also considered the most backward in Bihar, has a 47% Muslim population as against Bihar's state-wide average of 17%,\" according to a 2020 National Herald report.The demography of Seemanchal districts like Kishanganj, Araria, Katihar and Purnea has enabled Bangladeshis to blend in seamlessly.What is ironic is that the name Seemanchal itself reveals the change. The region was regarded as part of the larger Kosi-Mithila belt, and experts opine that the new nomenclature is a calculated move to create a sub-regional identity.The region contributes 24 seats to Bihar's 243-member Assembly.Bihar has 7.9 crore voters and will likely hold election later. Currently, the BJP-led NDA is in power in the state, with JD(U) leader Nitish Kumar the chief minister. Purnia MP Pappu Yadav speaking during a conference in Patna, on June 29. The Independent Lok Sabha MP, who supports the Opposition INDIA bloc in the lower house, declared a 'Bihar Bandh' on July 9 against the SIR drive of the Election Commission. (PTI Image) LIST OF 11 DOCUMENTS, 2003 VOTER ROLLS FOR VERIFICATIONThe last intensive revision of electoral rolls in Bihar was conducted in 2003, over two decades ago.The EC, in a statement issued on June 24, cited reasons like rapid urbanisation, frequent migration, young citizens becoming eligible to vote, non-reporting of deaths and inclusion of the names of foreign illegal immigrants for the revision of rolls.In Bihar, the poll body is conducting a door-to-door exercise, which began on June 25 and will continue till September 30, to collect enumeration forms to verify genuine voters.Of the 7.9 crore voters in Bihar, around 5 crore were in the January 1, 2003, last scrutinised list and only need to submit an extract from that roll. The remaining 2.9 crore voters must produce at least one document from a list of 11 documents.The list doesn't include Aadhaar card, PAN and driving licence, generally used across India as ID proofs.The simple reason is that none of these documents are proof of citizenship.As voting in India is a right that comes with being an Indian, people will need to provide documents that prove they are citizens.Government-issued identity card or pension payment order, birth certificate, passport, matriculation certificate, permanent residence, caste or forest right certificates are among the 11 documents that will work to prove date and place of birth.List of 11 Accepted Documents for Voter Verification (for those not in 2003 Rolls)S.No.Document Type1Identity card Pension Payment Order of a PSU employee or pensioner2ID Certificate Document issued by government, local bodies, banks, post offices, LIC, PSU (pre-July 1, 1987)3Birth certificate issued by a competent authority4Passport5Matriculation Educational certificate from a recognised board or university6Permanent residence certificate issued by competent state authority7Forest Rights Certificate8OBC SC ST or any valid caste certificate9National Register of Citizens (NRC), wherever it exists10Family register11Land or house allotment certificateWHY EXPERTS FEEL THE EXERCISE MIGHT DELIST VOTERSThe EC has divided the voters into three categories for the verification drive. Each category needs to furnish a different set of documents.The two significant years here are 1987 and 2004. In those last two years, India brought in laws to prevent illegal immigrants from gaining citizenship.The EC exercise is aligned with the Citizenship Amendment Act, 2003, which was notified in 2004, and the documents sought are according to the law.Those born before July 1, 1987, are most likely to be on the 2003 revised voter list. They just need to submit the enumeration form with the extract of the 2003 roll, which has been made available online.The 2003 voter list would be treated as the base document with those on the list and their children using it to file the enumeration form.Those born between July 1, 1987, and December 2, 2004, have to provide one of the 11 documents for themselves, establishing date and place of birth. And also provide any of the documents for one of the parents.For those born after December 2, 2004, other than a document for themselves proving the date and place of birth, documents proving the citizenship of both parents are required.CategoryYear of BirthRequired DocumentsCategory 1: Likely on the 2003 voter listBefore July 1, 1987Only Enumeration Form (no additional documents needed if name is on 2003 list)Category 2: Self + One Parent's ProofBetween July 1, 1987 and Dec 2, 2004One of 11 Documents for self (date & place of birth) + One document for one parentCategory 3: Self + Both Parents' ProofAfter December 2, 2004One of 11 Documents for self (date & place of birth) + Documents for both parents' citizenshipIn the case of Bihar, the EC has clarified that 60% of the voters don't need to furnish any documents after it uploaded the 2003 record on its website.Though Bihar is the second most-populous state after Uttar Pradesh, the record of births and issuance of certificates has been historically low.However, that shouldn't be the case for those born in the 2000s. Also, officials and the EC are banking on the fact that the young voters will have one of the several listed documents.Critics are also suggesting that the idea of a universal adult franchise will now get pegged around education, with a matriculation certificate being one of the basic documents suggested.WHAT ARE OPPOSITION PARTIES OBJECTING TOThere are two reasons why the long-overdue process has kicked up a political storm. One is the list of documents, and the other is the window in which the exercise is being conducted.According to reports, the EC earlier conducted intensive revisions of electoral rolls six to eight months ahead of polls. The window in this case is three-four months at best.However, the EC is confident that its well-oiled machinery is more than capable of conducting the exercise in the given time period.Other than the 77,895 block-level officers (BLOs), \"20,603 BLOs are being appointed for the smooth and timely completion of the process,\" the EC said on July 6. Four lakh volunteers, including government officials and NCC cadets, were working in the field to assist \"vulnerable populations\", and 1.5 lakh booth-level agents of political parties were also helping out, it added.Opposition parties are contending that the exercise, too close to the Assembly polls in Bihar, will not give an opportunity to those left out of the rolls, especially the poor and the unlettered, to challenge the decision and get back as voters in time.They are calling it votebandi, that is following the notebandi (demonetisation) and deshbandi (lockdown).The Congress alleges that the SIR of electoral rolls would lead to poor and tribal voters being disenfranchised. It says the exercise carries a huge risk of wilful exclusion of voters using the power of the State machinery.It was the Congress itself that raised doubts over the electoral rolls after the 2024 Assembly election in Maharashtra.Purnia MP Rajesh Ranjan, better known as Pappu Yadav, has urged voters in Bihar's Seemanchal region to not cooperate with the BLOs conducting the SIR. He says the exercise could disenfranchise marginalised communities.\"Don’t show any documents; they will use these documents as an excuse to delete your vote,\" said the Lok Sabha MP, who is an Independent but supports the opposition INDIA bloc in Parliament. He has called a Bihar bandh on July 9 against the intensive revision of electoral rolls.AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi accused the EC of using the SIR to \"secretly implement the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Bihar\". Mamata Banerjee and her Trinamool Congress too alleged that the EC exercise was a \"sinister move\" to \"bring NRC through the backdoor\". The West Bengal CM called the exercise, a scam.The Trinamool Congress has also gone ahead and suggested that the EC treat the 2024 voter list as the base year for any revision of electoral rolls.This is quite stunning coming from the ruling party of a state like West Bengal that has seen large-scale illegal immigration from Bangladesh. Regular rioting in Bengal, the latest of which was during anti-waqf law protests, has been blamed on the change in demography of its districts.Making 2024 the base year would also legalise illegal voters who have made it to the electoral lists in the last 20 years.The argument against the 11 documents is equally stunning. How can documents, like PAN and Aadhaar, which are issued declaring that they aren't proof of citizenship be allowed to prove citizenship?AN ARGUMENT FOR REVISION OF ELECTORAL ROLLSThe value of a citizen's vote is sacrosanct. That is why the country also holds the delimitation exercise.It must be ensured that only genuine citizens get to vote. The special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls is the only way to ensure that.On July 6, the EC said that the initial phase of Bihar SIR had been completed. It said 1.69 crore or 21.46% of the total enumeration forms had been collected.The SIR is a much-needed exercise, and the government should enable all genuine citizens to prove their citizenship. The EC has vowed that no genuine voter will be dropped from the vetted list.If the electoral rolls aren't vetted now, or if the base year is changed, then there is a risk of illegal immigrants, and India has millions of them getting into or continuing on the electoral rolls.The end result will be people who have no stake in India's growth and those not rooted in the nation's ethos making decisions that will impact its politics and policy. India is at a crossroads, and it can't surrender to clamour. If the exercise isn't conducted now, it might be too late.- EndsPublished By: Sushim MukulPublished On: Jul 7, 2025Must Watch",

    "content": "The Uttar Pradesh Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) dismantled a major illegal religious conversion racket operating out of Balrampur district, said officials.\nThe authorities have arrested Jamaluddin, also known as “Changur Baba,” the alleged mastermind who had a bounty of Rs 50,000 on his head. Officials added that his associate, Neetu alias Nasreen, has also been taken into custody.\nAdditional Director General (Law and Order) Amitabh Yash said the accused operated a widespread network targeting girls from a specific religious group, with alleged caste-based “conversion rates”.\nThe operation was reportedly backed by foreign funding amounting to nearly Rs 100 crore, the official said, adding that the funds are suspected to have originated from Islamic countries.\nInvestigators revealed that the accused used the funds to acquire multiple luxury properties, bungalows, high-end vehicles, and showrooms.\nOver 40 bank accounts—some opened under fictitious names—were used to route the money, suggesting large-scale money laundering.\nSources told News18 that Changur Baba had earlier been involved in gemstone sales and rose to prominence after a stint in Mumbai, allegedly through contacts with a Sindhi couple.\nHis local influence grew significantly, and he even contested village head and district council elections.\nOne of his close aides, Markandey Mishra, said that Changur Baba had predetermined conversion rates for Hindu girls and used his residence and shrine to further his agenda.\nAnother associate, Mohammad Ahmed Khan, is said to have helped manage and secure Baba’s illicit properties across various locations.\nKhan, described as the “right hand” of Changur Baba, has multiple criminal cases registered against him in Balrampur, Ambedkar Nagar, and Lucknow. Sources alleged that he used these assets for anti-national activities.\nATS sources also indicated that part of the foreign funding was used to purchase a significant property in Pune. Investigations into the financial trail and political links are ongoing.\nNews18 accessed the hotel ID records of Jamaluddin and Neetu, revealing the room where they were hiding at the time of arrest. The details, including hotel registers, have been shared with authorities.\nBJP MP Dr Nishikant Dubey questioned the larger political motive behind such conversions, claiming Jamaluddin (alias Changur Baba) and Nasreen (formerly Nusrat) received hundreds of crores to convert Hindus in India and Nepal, allegedly for vote-bank politics.\nThe ATS continues to probe deeper into the foreign connections and political dimensions of the case.",

    "title": "World News | Nepal: Nagarik Unmukti Party Withdraws Support from Oli-led Government, Floor Test Likely",
    "content": "Kathmandu [Nepal], July 5 (ANI): The Nagarik Unmukti Party has decided to walk out of the ruling alliance led by Nepal Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, following the removal of its minister in a provincial government. As per the constitutional provision stated in Article 100 (2), the Prime Minister is now obliged to seek a vote of confidence in the House of Representatives. The party, which holds four seats in the House, took the decision during a parliamentary party meeting held on Saturday in Kathmandu in protest against the removal of one of its ministers by the Chief Minister of Sudurpaschim Province. Also Read | Benjamin Netanyahu-IDF Chief Clash Over Gaza Evacuation: 'We Have Soldiers Dying in Battle', Says Gen Eyal Zamir in Stormy Meeting Over Plan to Displace Gazans.\n\"The parliamentary committee meeting that convened today (Saturday) in Kathmandu has decided to retract support to the incumbent government, and we will stay in the opposition. Our minister on board the government will also resign tomorrow (Sunday),\" Ranjeeta Shrestha, Chairperson of the party, told ANI over the phone. The party currently has Arun Kumar Chaudhary serving as a state minister in the KP Sharma Oli-led government. On Friday, the party had already withdrawn its support from the Nepali Congress-led provincial government in Sudurpaschim.

Kamal Bahadur Shah from the Nepali Congress is the incumbent Chief Minister in the Sudurpaschim Province. \"We also will make the formal announcement of our change in the coalition during the parliamentary procession of the House of Representatives,\" Chairperson Shrestha added further. Following the walkout of Nagarik Unmukti Party, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli has to test the floor, as per the constitutional provisions. Article 100 (2) of the Constitution of Nepal said, \"The Prime Minister shall table a motion for the vote of confidence in the House of Representatives if the party which the Prime Minister represents is divided or the party in the government withdraws its support.\" However, there has been ongoing debate over the interpretation of this provision, with many contesting the provision, claiming the Prime Minister in the incumbent government has a comfortable majority, which does not trigger the provision in the prevailing situation. The present coalition of the Communist Party of Nepal-Unified Marxist Leninist (CPN-UML) and the Nepali Congress will have a comfortable majority even after the exit of the Nagarik Unmukti Party. The support of 138 lawmakers is required to secure a majority in the 275-member House of Representatives, which the coalition has to continue to hold power.

    "title": "Revival of SAARC: new regional order",
    "content": "With the paralysis of The South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) since 2016, South Asia’s dream of economic and political integration has remained frozen. But today, a new dynamic is emerging—one that is being steered not by New Delhi but by Beijing and Islamabad.\n\nChina and Pakistan are exploring a Beijing-led regional alternative to revitalize cooperation in South Asia. This development could redefine regional power dynamics, marginalize India’s influence, and establish parallel regional orders. While this initiative opens new economic and diplomatic opportunities for smaller South Asian nations, it also introduces risks of regional fragmentation and geo-strategic rivalry. \n\nThis brief outlines the key motivations, implications, and strategic options for the main stakeholders—Pakistan, China, India, and smaller regional states. Pakistan sees opportunity in SAARC where India sees stalemate as its advantage. With SAARC in paralysis and India preoccupied with bilateralism and Indo-Pacific strategic partnerships, Islamabad is stepping into the regional vacuum—backed by China’s economic and diplomatic might.\n\nA China-led platform would give Pakistan renewed regional relevance, potentially connecting it with Afghanistan, Central Asia, Iran, and smaller South Asian states through corridors like the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). More importantly, it would allow Pakistan to escape India’s veto on regional initiatives and present itself as a gateway between South Asia, the Middle East, and Eurasia.\n\nFor China, South Asia has long been India’s backyard. But with the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), military outreach, and now possible regional institutions, Beijing is embedding itself into the region’s architecture. \n\n A China-led SAARC alternative allows Beijing to increase soft power projection, open trade corridors, and potentially reshape the rules of economic and security engagement in Asia. With growing partnerships in Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives, China is positioning itself as an integrator where India is increasingly seen as an abstainer.\n\nIndia’s boycott of SAARC in 2016 could be politically understandable; but it was strategically costly. While New Delhi has shifted focus to the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) for economic benefits and to be a part of group of four countries — India, Japan, Australia, Japan and United States—for Asia Pacific security dialogue (QUAD), and bilateral diplomacy, it has effectively abandoned leadership of regional integration. \n\nIndia remains the region’s largest economy, but its reluctance to engage in a regional forum with Pakistan has eroded its credibility as a unifying force in South Asia. In contrast, China—despite being an outsider—has built multilateral leverage through connectivity, infrastructure, and diplomacy. New Delhi now faces a dilemma: rejoin the regional table and reclaim its leadership role, or risk seeing its neighbors drift further into China’s orbit. India has a choice to be a spoiler or a beneficiary.\n\nWith two parallel regional visions emerging — one led by India (BIMSTEC and Indo-Pacific frameworks QUAD) and another by China and Pakistan (possibly BRI-aligned) — South Asia risks becoming more divided than ever. For smaller nations, this presents both opportunity and risk. They can leverage competition for development gains, but also face mounting pressure to choose sides. \n\nThe main challenge in this emerging bifurcation for the region is not just diplomatic; it’s economic and social. South Asia, which is home to a quarter of the world’s population, remains one of the least integrated regions globally. Its intra-regional trade is a mere fraction of what it could be, while cooperation on energy, migration, climate change, and water resources is minimal. \n\nThe region must be provided a chance and an enabling environment to prioritize economic pragmatism over bloc politics. It could push for legally binding frameworks that protect sovereignty and prevent debt distress. What South Asia needs is not two rival orders, but a common platform of mutual respect, inclusivity, and economic interdependence.\n\nA China-Pakistan-led regional bloc could reshape South Asian cooperation in the post-SAARC era. While it offers opportunities for development and new alignments, it also raises concerns about exclusion, dependency, and geopolitical competition. The region’s stability and progress demand a balanced, inclusive, and multipolar framework where all regional countries are one among equals and have freedom to jointly work together and not the replacement of one hegemonic model with another.\n\nChina must tread carefully. Smaller South Asian countries value development aid but are wary of becoming pawns in great power games. If the new forum is seen as a geopolitical project rather than a cooperative one, regional resistance could rise. South Asia does not need two rival orders; it needs a common platform of mutual respect, inclusivity, and economic interdependence.\n\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2025",

    "title": "Nile Rodgers talks kilts, Kazakhstan and why CHIC belong to Glasgow",
    "content": "Nile Rodgers is buzzing to be playing Barrowland in Glasgow next month with his band CHIC as the Glasgow venue has a special place in the heart of the 72-year-old musician, songwriter, guitarist and record producer. Fresh from a triumphant Glastonbury performance and gigs elsewhere in the UK, the Netherlands, Ireland and Italy, Rodgers will be strapping on his signature hit-maker Fender Stratocaster with Chic as they lead the audience through a dance-fuelled set of hits such as Dance, Dance, Dance, Everybody Dance, Le Freak, I Want Your Love and Good Times. Over Zoom from the US Rodgers is his usual smiling self, complete with hat and long locks, straight away telling me how much Chic love playing Barrowland, having played there multiple times. So what is it about Glasgow’s legendary venue that gets the icon into the groove every time? “It’s the vibe of the Barrowland. It’s all about the people. The reason I love coming back is because of the sense of appreciation and fulfillment we get. You can’t really compare that to anything else. It’s like when we finish a show we’re basically done, we’re exhausted at the end of our shows, but the crowd there, they’re ready to go again, they wish we could do another one. It’s insane.” “We’re spent but they’re revved up and ready to go and that energy is incredible. I said last time we played there, ‘man, you guys are louder than Concorde taking off!’ The decibel level was just insane,” Like Barrowland Rodgers’ has legendary status, his life and musical trajectory forged through his tough upbringing on New York’s Lower East Side. His parents, an interracial couple, were hippies, high-functioning heroin addicts and music lovers and the extraordinarily musically talented young Rodgers became the family bread winner early, landing his first professional jobs as a guitarist in the Sesame Street band when he was 17 or 18 as well as playing in the house band at the famous Harlem Apollo. Having learned to play flute and clarinet in school, among other instruments, he loved jazz, classical music, rock and fully embraced the DJ and club culture of New York in the 1970s. Chic was born in 1972, co-founded by Rodgers and bassist Bernard Edwards and their disco hits featuring the former’s distinctive chop chord chucking style filled the world’s dance floors. He also created songs for Sister Sledge, Diana Ross, David Bowie, Madonna, Daft Punk, Beyonce and many more with Chic’s Good Times hit illustrating his musical reach by influencing The Sugarhill Gang’s breakthrough hip hop single Rapper’s Delight, Queen, Blondie, Captain Sensible and Daft Punk and beyond. Given how many times Chic have played in Scotland does Rodgers have any tartan in his wardrobe. “I do, obviously because I’ve been there too many times to not. But what was really interesting is that I’m doing a private party and they want me kilted up in their family garb, so I said ‘well, whatever, I’m down, you know?’. Will he be donning a kilt? “That’s what they want me to do, so I said OK. Not at the Barrowland but yeah, we’re doing a couple of private gigs.” Unfortunately Rodgers and Chic won’t have any time to hang about in Scotland this time round as it’s straight on to the next gig. “This tour, almost every show is in a different city the next day. Typically, because of my charity work, I don’t like to travel by private aircraft because that same money I could be spending on the kids in my programme, but it’s the only way to do this tour because we’re in one city and the next day in another country and the following day another. It’s crazy. This is going to be the most cities that we’ve hit in one summer in my entire career,” he says. It’s a schedule which is remarkable given that Rogers is now 72 years old. “Yes, thank you for bringing that up,” he says and laughs, then I tell him he’s in great company as Herbie Hancock, now 85, was in Scotland tearing up the Edinburgh Festival in 2022. “Yeah, he’s a great friend of mine. I just saw him a couple of weeks ago,” says Rodgers. Read More - Herbie Hancock interview, 2022 Both men have achieved legendary status that sees them revered across the whole music industry with their influence felt far and wide and down the generations. How does that feel? “It’s amazing but I don’t think of it like that,” says Rodgers. “I’m just doing my job. “But as a composer, as a creator, as a producer, an orchestrator and arranger, whatever you want to call me, guitar player, to be able to create and have that creation become meaningful to other people’s lives, that’s an extraordinary feeling.” “I don’t know how to explain it. Well… near the end of the first leg of this tour, at the last show, I said ‘I want to do this for the rest of my life until I can’t do it any more’. You know, that’s just how I feel. I love the feeling that we’re giving back because the crowd seems to be SO appreciative. My god, the last few shows we just did in South America were over the top!” Having been on the road for decades Rodgers has played “every country in the world”, some of them multiple times, but last year’s visit to Kazakhstan made an impression. “Before we went I kept thinking to myself the only thing I know about Kazakhstan is the character Sascha Baron Cohen plays in Borat and that horrible song he sings all the time, and I get to Kazakhstan and people were awesome. We had so much fun. I couldn’t believe the way that the vibe felt walking down the street. I didn’t seem to look peculiar to people, even though I know that I don’t typically dress like your average Kazakhstani but man, we had so much fun. “And we were making a joke, me and the girls in my band, and I said you know, for the last couple of years of Prince’s life he always played Le Freak, stuck it in the middle of a song, and I said we’re going to stick in Jungle Love, and we started doing the dance and the client who brought us in jumped right in with us and started doing the Jungle Love dance. It was incredible. We were in Kazakhstan and he knew exactly where we were coming from culturally, and I thought to myself, that’s the beauty of music and that’s really what the world is. People are beautiful. Government’s pretty much stink,” he laughs, “but people are awesome.” Read More - Nile Rodgers interview 2018 Rodgers agrees that the beauty of music is that it transcends politics. “When I go to a country that’s supposed to be awful, the promoters say ‘oh you don’t want to go for a walk out there’ and I hear ‘Nile, ha ha, take off’, because I love meeting people. I love other cultures and I’m fascinated.” He traces his love of travel right back to his early years when he had no money but explored anyway. “When I was a kid it was very common for people like myself who were very poor to do what we call hostelling, and you go to these very, very inexpensive little, you can’t even call them hotels, they were just little rooms, rooming houses set up for basically teenagers to go around and explore the world. I don’t even know what’s happened to that,” he says. No, hostels are still very much a thing, I tell him. “Oh, OK. I guess I’m not a teenager anymore! I’m 72 years old and I can actually stay in a real hotel. But that was like the thing. So meeting new people and going to different countries was a normal thing. I remember my girlfriend turned me on to this and there was no such thing as stranger danger. I never heard a bad story, like now it seems that’s all we hear. And I know mathematically that there are no more bad people now than there were then, so I just take it as mostly people are good, and every now and then you meet jerks, but most of the time people are really cool.” With the extensive touring, producing, writing and charity work that Rodgers is involved in, is he ever able to go and watch other musicians play? “Rarely. I love to, but it’s rare. I saw Esperanza Spalding and Adam Lambert at the Polar awards [The 2025 Polar Music Prize ceremony in Stockholm last month], and that was great, that was cool and fun, but that’s not my normal life. “My normal life is I’m going from one place to the next. I rarely have leisure time because I’m working on other projects. Doing live gigs is not my life, that’s just one small part of it.” With Barrowland ready and waiting does Rodgers have the playlist ready for the gig, and is it a set or does it change? “It changes all the time because we have an idea of the amount of time that we have on stage. As a person, I’m very cognisant of other artists and I never go over time. Chic is incredibly prompt. We’re like a machine. And what’s really interesting is that we’re not a machine, we’re a completely live band. Almost every band you see has click tracks and secret backing tracks and stuff like that, and believe me I know, because I know almost every band out there, but we’re completely live. “But we’re very prompt. I have my stage manager saying ‘OK, you’ve got five minutes, three minutes, two minutes, you’ve got to be on stage’. We’re very, very, very cognisant of the other acts, and because we’re live, we’re not locked to a clock, so we have to be aware of how much time we’re on stage because sometimes I’ll talk and just go off the rails and start telling stories and that’s not really what we’re there for. We’re there to play music. But sometimes you can’t help it. The vibe is so great. And because I’ve been to all these countries so many times I have nothing but great memories that sometimes I want to share, so I tell them.” And will he be playing his trademark white Fender Stratocaster with the maple fingerboard? “Of course. It’s the only guitar I play. If I break a string the audience has to wait for me to change the string.” Does he not have a spare, or other guitars? “I have tons of them, but I only play that one.” Read More - Laura Mvula interview 2021 Looking back over his lengthy career, of what is Rodgers most proud, some of the hits, his influence on other musicians, his longevity, his success, his charity work? “That’s really high on my list,” he says, referring to his We Are Family Foundation, set up in 2008 and which has funded schools in Malawi, Mali, Nepal and Nicaragua, created a diversity and tolerance curriculum that was sent to every elementary school in the US and is dedicated to create programmes that ‘promote cultural diversity while nurturing and mentoring the vision, talents and ideas of young people who are positively changing the world’. “What we’re doing now, it’s beyond anything I ever thought we could accomplish and now I know we gotta be doing SO much more because the people in my life now, and just what’s going on in America now, it drives me to work in other situations and it opens my mind to developing programmes in other countries because now I really see that… God, you know, there’s so much going on in the world that really governments don’t address, and we really deal with young people who are addressing those problems and actually making a change. “And when I was a kid, that’s what my life was like. It was not only discovering the problem or becoming aware of the problem but it was actually working on the problem, helping to mend the problem, trying to fix it. On a previous occasion Rodgers told me how when he was a child he had fallen behind a sofa pushed against a wall in the family home and was stuck there for hours, unnoticed. What would he say to that child now, a scared little boy who has no idea how his life will unfold? “It’s going to be amazing.” He pauses and thinks back. “I thought I was dying. I couldn’t breathe. I had asthma. I can’t believe that you know that story. Yeah, I fell behind the sofa, and I was a skinny, skinny, skinny little kid and had really bad asthma, and who’d ever have thought that I’d go on to make music for a living? “Actually I thought that then, believe it or not, but I never would have imagined that it would get to this level, that I’d do songs and video games and theatre and pop records and classical records and jazz records, I mean just anything that artistically comes my way that I’m interested in. It’s amazing.” Which just leaves time to wish him all the best for the Barrowland gig and the rest of the tour. “Thank you. I hope I’ll see you all at the show.” Nile Rodgers & CHIC will be at Barrowland, Glasgow on Tuesday 12 and Wednesday 13 of August. See barrowland.co.uk",

    "title": "FFD4 Seville: Key outcomes show some hope, but wider systems remain paralysed",
    "content": "The 4th International Conference on Financing for Development (FfD4) came to a close in Seville, Spain, on July 3, concluding a once-in-a-decade process where countries deliberate on the challenge of financing sustainable development, facilitated by the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs.As the outcome document — titled Compromiso de Sevilla (Seville Commitment) — was already agreed upon prior to the conference on June 17, proceedings in Seville mainly involved plenary statements from leaders, multistakeholder roundtables on key issues and hundreds of side events. The side events in particular drew a wide spectrum of speakers, including governments, UN agencies, private finance stakeholders, civil society and academia.On the final day, while delegates and financial system stakeholders deliberated on technical issues at side events, civil society raised chants demanding debt cancellation, climate justice, taxing the rich and system change..Some key outcomes of Ffd4.The Seville Platform for Action was launched on Day 1 and is the implementation arm of the Seville Commitment (Compromiso de Sevilla). Over 130 voluntary initiatives were announced to implement the outcome document, aimed at helping countries mobilise resources for an increased UN-mandated Sustainable Development Goals investment push. Though wide-ranging, the initiatives fall under three major themes that reflect the conference’s objective of reshaping the landscape of financing for development:.Scaling up finance mobilisation and investments: New partnerships and tools were announced to unlock private capital and boost domestic resource mobilisation within countries. Notable efforts in this direction include SCALED, a platform led by multiple countries to expand blended finance; FX EDGE, a set of tools created by the Inter-American Development Bank to overcome the barrier of currency volatility in foreign loans for development by facilitating more local currency financing and the Coalition for Global Solidarity Levies, which suggests taxing premium air travel and private jets to raise money for climate and development goals.Tackling the debt crisis: Several initiatives focused on solutions to the sovereign debt crisis, particularly unsustainable external debt for developing countries. The Global Hub for Debt Swaps for Development, launched by the Government of Spain and the World Bank, is to provide technical and financial support to countries considering ‘swapping’ their debt for food security and/or climate change adaptation. The Debt Pause Clause Alliance, launched by the government of Spain with Barbados, France and others and multiple multilateral development banks (MDB), pushed for the inclusion of clauses that temporarily suspend the repayment of external debt of a country in the event of an external shock, including natural disasters, food or health emergencies. Notably, the Sevilla Borrower’s Forum was launched as a collective platform to bring together expertise and align negotiation efforts among borrowers, mainly from the Global South.Financial architecture reform: Countries and institutions committed to shifting the structures of global development finance. A key initiative in this regard is the Global Financing Playbook, which aims to foster collaboration between finance and development institutions and coordinate international support to deliver financing aligned with a country’s national priorities. The Beyond GDP Global Alliance was also launched, a coalition of countries and partners advocating for the use of broader economic indicators, beyond just gross domestic product, in shaping policy and financial decisions..Additionally, sector-specific initiatives were announced too, including several pertaining to climate-related financing. .What was in the text? .Unlike typical UN conferences where negotiations take centre stage, Compromiso de Sevilla was adopted ahead of FfD4 and formally endorsed during the summit. Countries instead focused on announcing the Seville Action Plan as the main path forward. Still, negotiations leading up to the Compromiso were fraught, shaped by deep power and economic imbalances that disadvantage developing countries by design.Between July 2024 and June 2025, the co-facilitators of the FfD4 outcome document (Mexico, Nepal, Norway, and Zambia) led a drafting process, beginning with an Elements Paper informed by nearly 300 stakeholder inputs. This shaped the Zero Draft published in January 2025, followed by the First Draft in March, both refined through feedback from member states. Negotiations on the outcome document abruptly concluded on June 17, 2025, when the UN Preparatory Committee adopted the Compromiso. The process had been stalled by US objections, with the ‘silence procedure’ broken on nearly every paragraph. In a dramatic turn, the US withdrew from the process during the final session, clearing the way for consensus among the remaining countries.Other Global North countries, including the EU, UK, Switzerland, Canada and Japan, dissociated from core commitments on a UN tax convention and sovereign debt mechanisms. This reflected broader resistance to shifting financial governance away from institutions dominated by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development or OECD..FFd4 Seville: Leaders open conference with calls for debt relief, representation and support for multilateralism.Despite the circulation of a final draft on June 12, nearly every paragraph drew objections – revealing efforts by some states to stall progress. The final Compromiso was weakened in key areas: Language on fossil fuel subsidies was deleted, and on asset registries diluted. Commitments on international tax, investor-state dispute settlement and special drawing rights (SDR) were also watered down. In particular, the SDR section lost specific calls for IMF reforms, weakening proposals to speed up and democratise SDR allocation.On debt architecture, while the final text retained a UN-led intergovernmental process, its mandate was diluted, prompting criticism from civil society that the softening risks undermining SDG progress amid escalating debt crises. Relatedly, the launch of an African Credit Rating Agency was included in the text. It aims to address unfair biases and systemic issues in the big three credit rating agencies, whose ratings contribute to the “Africa premium”, significantly increasing borrowing costs for African countries. This was welcomed by some civil society groups. The civil society also welcomed the inclusion of a global debt registry in the text, however, some raised concerns about it being hosted by the World Bank. The commitment calls for consolidating existing debt databases into a single global registry at the Bank to improve transparency, harmonise reporting and ease borrower burdens.Ultimately, while the document marked some modest progress, experts like Daniela Gabor criticised it for reinforcing de-risking that benefits investors more, without meaningful safeguards. As she wrote, it failed to adopt stronger oversight, fiscal limits or protections for public services, and instead promotes vague monitoring and partnerships that risk deepening inequality..FFD4 Seville: What are the links to the climate talks and the road from Seville to COP30 at Belem?.Anxious expression of global crises.FFD4 represented a crucial moment where a multilateral process raised the issue of funding needed to achieve developing countries’ development and climate goals. In an atmosphere of aid cuts, trade tensions, growing economic nationalism in developed countries and global wars, the outlook for securing the additional financing required to build crucial infrastructure in a low-carbon, climate-resilient way is bleak at best. And in this moment, the demands placed on FFD4 to deliver vital transformations in the global finance, debt and aid architecture were lofty.Some progress was recorded in the outcome document — offering, at best, small indicators or ‘hooks’ for civil society to push for further change in the coming months and years.A broader trend of shifting responsibility onto the private sector to fill the infrastructure financing gap — consistent with the narratives of ‘de-risking’, ‘billions to trillions’ and ‘mobilising private capital’ of the past decade or more — was widespread in Seville. Parallel side events, separated by barely a wall, featured panel discussions of private sector representatives discussing “catalytic instruments to crowd in private capital and prove out commercial viability”, while in other rooms, civil society highlighted the “vicious cycle of debt, poverty and climate-induced crisis” and demanded transformative, not incremental, change. In rooms where critiques of the three big credit rating agencies (CRA) were raised by experts, representatives of the same CRAs showed up and seemingly ‘acknowledged’ the problems with subjective ratings of developing countries but offered little recourse. There was recognition in some sessions of systemic issues such as the limitations of Basel III regulations, the unwillingness of rich country central banks to rechannel Special Drawing Rights to MDBs for development financing in poorer countries and the impact of climate shocks on sovereign credit ratings.What Seville produced was an anxious expression of global crises from developing countries and a clenched admission of the same from the rich. Everyone knew that the rules of the system are rigged against the developing world and expectations of “bankability” and profits from what should essentially be global public goods — such as low-carbon, climate-resilient infrastructure — are delusional at best. Some promising paragraphs in the text, a token (but important) private jet levy proposed here, a tax on the rich there, offered a few rays of hope. Beyond that, the systemic paralysis endured under the blaze of the southern Spain heatwave and the work continues to fight for a better future for 80 per cent of the world’s population..Read all the news related to climate change in Hindi",

    "title": "Nepal Targets Dailekh Gas and Dhauwadi Iron by 2032",
    "content": "Nepal has set an ambitious plan to use its local natural resources to strengthen the energy and industrial sectors. The government is aiming to harness natural gas from Dailekh and begin iron production from Dhauwadi within the next several years.\n\nA new report from a Chinese exploration company has confirmed a major natural gas reserve in Jaljale, located in Bhairavi Rural Municipality of Dailekh. The report estimates the gas reserve at 112 billion cubic meters. This news has raised fresh hopes that Nepal can reduce its reliance on imported energy.\n\nMinister for Industry, Commerce and Supplies, Damodar Bhandari, shared the update this week. He said that Nepal is now focused on turning these findings into real results. The goal is to begin using the Dailekh gas within a year. The long-term aim is to provide this gas for household and industrial use across the country.\n\nThe natural gas in Dailekh has been a topic of interest for years, but recent steps by the government suggest that action is finally being taken. A detailed survey has already been completed, and a team of officials is working on how to begin safe and cost-effective extraction.\n\nAccording to experts, 112 billion cubic meters of natural gas is a huge amount for a country like Nepal. If used well, this could meet a large part of Nepal’s energy needs for years to come. It could also help reduce the high cost of imported fuel and support local job creation.\n\nAt the same time, the government is also pushing forward plans to extract iron ore from Dhauwadi in East Nawalparasi. The site has long been known to contain high-grade iron ore. However, there have been delays in starting the project due to technical and policy hurdles.\n\nNow, under the direction of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies is taking active steps. The target is to begin iron production from the Dhauwadi mine by 2085 BS (2028 AD). This move is expected to reduce Nepal’s dependence on imported steel and boost domestic industries.\n\nIron ore from Dhauwadi could support large-scale production of construction materials. This is vital for Nepal, which is investing heavily in roads, buildings, and other infrastructure. The project could also open up new jobs and business opportunities in East Nawalparasi and surrounding areas.\n\nMinister Bhandari stressed that both projects—Dailekh gas and Dhauwadi iron—are important parts of Nepal’s plan to use its own natural resources. He said that careful planning and international cooperation will be needed to meet the set goals. The government is working closely with technical experts to ensure safety and environmental protection during resource extraction.\n\nThe Department of Mines and Geology is now preparing to invite both local and international firms to take part in the projects. The aim is to begin work as early as next year. Officials say that with good planning and strong political support, these two projects can become success stories for Nepal.\n\nIn addition to energy and raw materials, these projects also hold economic value. Experts say that using local gas and iron could save Nepal millions of dollars each year. It could also help balance trade deficits by cutting down on fuel and metal imports.\n\nPeople living near the Dailekh and Dhauwadi sites have welcomed the government’s new push. Many see this as a chance for local growth, better roads, new jobs, and improved services. Local officials have promised that community needs will be respected as projects move forward.\n\nThe government hopes that these projects will not only strengthen Nepal’s economy but also set a model for future resource development. If successful, Nepal may explore other similar reserves in the country.\n\nBy focusing on Dailekh gas and Dhauwadi iron, Nepal is taking its first big step towards energy independence and industrial self-reliance.",

    "title": "Why SAARC still matters",
    "content": "The leaders of South Asia must recognize that the true potential for real and meaningful progress lies not in abandoning SAARC but in revitalizing it. Any consideration for establishing a new regional bloc to offset SAARC, risks further fragmenting South Asia rather than uniting it. SAARC’s stagnation stems from bilateral disputes and not structural flaws; replacing it with a bloc perceived as aligning with specific geopolitical interests could deepen divisions rather than bridge them.\n\nSAARC is not merely a diplomatic forum; it is a homegrown initiative rooted in shared geography, history, and cultural ties that bind South Asia together.\n\nSAARC frameworks such as the South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA), the SAARC Development Fund (SDF), and the SAARC Visa Exemption Scheme, are already in place but underutilized. Any new bloc would lack these established mechanisms, requiring years to replicate what SAARC has already built. For example, SAFTA potential to boost intra-regional trade beyond its current 5 percent remains untapped due to political barriers, not institutional inadequacies.\n\nThe call to revive SAARC is not nostalgic but pragmatic. The region 2 billion people 50 percent of whom live in poverty need SAARC frameworks to prioritise development over politics. Instead of sidelining SAARC, South Asian leaders must separate bilateral disputes from regional agendas, as ASEAN has done; fully operationalize SAFTA, expand visa exemptions, and launch joint infrastructure projects; scale up student exchanges, cultural programs, and trade delegations to build trust.\n\nSAARC’s foundations are solid; its tools are ready. What missing is the political courage to prioritize regional prosperity over narrow rivalries.\n\nHad SAARC remained active after its 18th Summit in 2014, it would have convened its 23rd Summit by 2024 and been preparing for a 24th, potentially providing an institutional mechanism to de-escalate tensions during the recent major conflict that brought India and Pakistan to the brink of war.\n\nThe recent escalation between India and Pakistan has severely jeopardised peace across South Asia, exacerbating regional instability in the absence of functional diplomatic platforms like SAARC.\n\nThe South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) has historically played a pivotal role in easing tensions among member states, prioritizing regional cooperation and the welfare of South Asian citizens. Notably, it has helped to mitigate conflicts, particularly between Pakistan and India, by facilitating dialogue and promoting peace.\n\nSAARC revival remains elusive. While member states maintain representatives at the Kathmandu Secretariat, the regional body remains largely inactive, raising questions about the political will for cooperation.\n\nSAARC has historically played a crucial role in promoting dialogue and cooperation among its member states. However, since the postponement of the 19th SAARC Summit scheduled for 2016 in Islamabad, Pakistan, a significant dialogue among member states has been absent.\n\nSAARC’s strength has never been about resolving political disputes directly, but about building everyday trust through student exchanges, shared markets, and coordinated disaster responses. These mechanisms are vital for peace. The South Asian University, based in New Delhi, was a visionary initiative. But imagine if it had branches in every member country, allowing students to study in Pakistan’s mountains, Sri Lanka’s coastlines, Indian plains or Nepal’s valleys. These shared classrooms would help dissolve stereotypes and build lifelong friendships. More exchange programmes would connect youth across borders, creating a generation shaped by shared experiences, not divided by old narratives.\n\nSAARC has already contributed to people’s well-being. Health clinics supported by the SAARC Development Fund (SDF) have quietly saved lives in remote areas. Food banks helped in times of drought. But these successes remain limited in reach. With stronger political support, such initiatives could grow, perhaps into regional vaccine drives or emergency response teams that move quickly across borders during disasters. These actions reflect the true spirit of SAARC: regional unity to improve the lives of ordinary people.\n\nPeople visiting sacred sites across borders, craftswomen selling handmade textiles in neighbouring countries, or students pursuing education beyond their homeland are not grand political gestures, but simple human aspirations. Yet, current visa systems restrict such movements. The SAARC Visa Exemption Scheme, which allows limited travel for businesspeople, issues around 200 visas per country each year, a drop in the ocean for a region of two billion. For trade, tourism, and trust to flourish, this number must grow. A common SAARC tourist visa, long discussed but never implemented, could transform mobility in the region.\n\nDespite political pauses, the foundation of SAARC is solid. Signed agreements on energy, connectivity, trade, and social development await fuller implementation. What is needed now is not new declarations, but action. Scholarships for students, simplified travel rules, affordable flights, and business-friendly border policies could bring immediate benefits. Each time a young person crosses a border to study, a trader expands market, or a family visits a sacred place, the dream of SAARC lives on. When SAARC was functioning, summits offered space for dialogue and cooling of tensions. For example, previous meetings helped ease situations after the Kargil conflict and during military stand-offs. Today, with SAARC not functioning at its full potential, countries lack the diplomatic cushions that once helped avoid escalation.\n\nAnd yet, there is hope. Indian External Affairs Minister recently said that “SAARC is not off the table.” Pakistan, Bangladesh and other member countries have also expressed support for its revival. Leaders from Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan, Maldives, and Afghanistan have long stood behind the vision of SAARC. All maintain their diplomatic presence at the SAARC Secretariat in Kathmandu. The challenge is not about structure; it is about political will.\n\nSAARC is not a platform that can be replaced or replicated. It is built on a natural alliance, formed not just by geography, but by shared history, culture, and aspirations. The countries of South Asia are not distant partners; they are neighbours bound by centuries of interaction, migration, and exchange. From language and cuisine to festivals and philosophies, the region’s common threads run deep. No external alliance or global forum can substitute the unique foundation upon which SAARC stands. Its strength lies in the fact that it is a homegrown initiative, designed by South Asians, for South Asians, to address the region distinct challenges and unlock its collective potential.\n\nPeople of the region are not asking for the impossible. They want peace, opportunity, and the freedom to travel, learn, and work across borders. It’s time for SAARC to be reactivated, not just for governments but for the people it was meant to serve. As the famous saying goes, ‘Rivers don’t stop at borders. Why must we?’ When SAARC works as envisioned, it responds not with politics, but with a common vision, thriving marketplaces, and the quiet truth that the futures of South Asian people flow together.\n\n(The writer is the Secretary General of SAARC Chamber of Commerce and Industry)\n\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2025",

    "title": "Lot-drawing ceremony is a traditional religious ritual and historical convention that must be upheld in reincarnation of Living Buddhas: signed article",
    "content": "The following is a signed article by Liu Huan, an assistant research fellow at the Institute of Ethnology and Anthropology, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.\n\nLot-drawing ceremony is a traditional religious ritual and historical convention that must be upheld in reincarnation of Living Buddhas\n\nFor a long time, the 14th Dalai Lama has been spreading fallacies and misleading public opinion on the issue of selecting the reincarnations of late Living Buddhas. Recently, he has gone further, falsely claiming that the golden urn lot-drawing system has adopted improper means and caused serious damage to Xizang. His intention is to negate the legal status of the system, thereby repudiating the sovereign jurisdiction of the central government over Xizang, creating an illusion that Xizang was historically an “independent state,” and seeking so-called legitimacy for “Tibet independence.” In fact, the golden urn lot-drawing ceremony is an important innovation in the development of the Living Buddha reincarnation system in Tibetan Buddhism that dates back to the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911). The ceremony was established by law since the promulgation of the Imperially Approved Ordinance for Better Governance of Tibet (29-Article Ordinance) in 1793. Since then, it has become an essential procedure for the identification of the reincarnations of the Dalai Lama, the Panchen Erdeni and other grand Living Buddhas, gaining wide support and recognition from Tibetan Buddhists. The ceremony has played an important role in sustaining the healthy development and inheritance of Tibetan Buddhism and maintaining social stability in Xizang.\n\nI. The golden urn lot-drawing system is a result of conforming to historical trends\n\nThe reincarnation of Living Buddhas is a method for religious leadership succession specific to Tibetan Buddhism. It was founded by the Karma Kagyu Sect in the 13th century and gradually adopted by other sects henceforth. Over the centuries, with the development and changes in the relation between politics and religion in Xizang, certain drawbacks in the reincarnation system were gradually exposed. In the Qing Dynasty, such problems became increasingly evident with Dharma protectors taking bribes and aristocrats colluding with temples to predetermine reincarnation candidates. Such behavior seriously disrupted the smooth successions of the grand Living Buddhas and even posed a potential threat to security in border areas.\n\nFrom the perspective of internal development, it became increasingly evident that members of the Tibetan aristocracy in the Qing Dynasty wantonly interfered with the selection and identification of reincarnations, in an attempt to expand their influence. When identifying reincarnations, the behavior of Chos Skyongs, or Dharma protectors who were responsible for practicing divination by drawing divining sticks or tossing coins, were left unchecked. Bribed by ecclesiastical and secular forces, they arbitrarily specified reincarnations — therefore most of the selected boys came from aristocratic families, seriously undermining the sanctity and fairness of the reincarnation system. For instance, when searching for the Eighth Dalai Lama’s reincarnation, although the Qing Dynasty government sent the third Zhangjia Living Buddha to Xizang to preside over related matters, the finally selected boy was related to the sixth Panchen; the younger brother and nephew of the third Zhangjia Living Buddha were respectively identified as the Nagya and Rakho Living Buddhas; the elder and younger brothers of the sixth Panchen became the Dhunpa Hutuktu of Tashilhumpo Monastery and the 10th Living Buddha of the red hat system of Karma Kagyu Sect respectively; one niece of the sixth Panchen was the Samding Dorje Phagmo Living Buddha. All these examples demonstrate manipulation by family forces on reincarnations. In response, Emperor Qianlong lamented in his article on Lamas that the reincarnations of grand Lamas seemed to have come from one family, which is almost the same as a hereditary title.\n\nFrom the perspective of the external political environment, the two invasions of Xizang by the Gorkha Tribe (located in central Nepal today) in the 18th century made the Qing Dynasty government realize that the lack of supervision over the selection of reincarnations of Living Buddhas in Tibetan Buddhism posed a threat to border stability. In 1779, the sixth Panchen traveled to Chengde to celebrate Emperor Qianlong’s 70th birthday, and received large amounts of tributes from Mongolian and Tibetan noblemen as well as generous rewards granted by the emperor along the way and during his stay in Beijing. Unfortunately, after the sixth Panchen passed away in Beijing, all these properties were controlled by one of his brothers — Dhunpa Hutuktu. However, another brother of his — the 10th Living Buddha of the red hat system of Karma Kagyu Sect — felt resentful and colluded with forces in Gorkha to invade Xizang and ransack the Tashilhunpo Monastery. The Qing Dynasty government sent troops to Xizang, with Fuk’anggan as the general. With the support of Tibetan monks and nuns, the Qing Dynasty troops forced the Gorkha troops to surrender and return the properties. The Gorkha invasion made the Qing Dynasty government realize that the combination of Living Buddha reincarnation and prominent families not only disrupted the succession order, but also posed deeper security risks. Failure to address this problem would lead to more serious border and territorial security issues. Faced with this grim situation, the Qing Dynasty government recognized the importance of strengthening the management of the reincarnation of Living Buddhas in Tibetan Buddhism.\n\nIn the face of various drawbacks, the Qing Dynasty government followed the trend of historical development and formulated the golden urn lot-drawing system. After the end of the Gorkha War, the Qing government issued the Imperially Approved Ordinance for Better Governance of Tibet (29-Article Ordinance) (hereinafter referred to as the “Ordinance”) in 1793, the first of which stipulated the establishment of the lot-drawing system. This system has henceforth been written into the Qing Dynasty’s regulation for the department of foreign-related affairs and established at the legal level. According to the regulation, when searching for the reincarnations of grand Living Buddhas, the names and birthdates of the candidates need to be written on signboards in Manchu, Han and Tibetan languages, and placed in a specially made golden urn. The Qing Dynasty government’s high commissioner in Xizang and the grand Living Buddhas would officially draw the lot to identify the signs in front of the statue of Sakyamuni Buddha in Jokhang Temple, and report to the central government for approval after selection. There are two golden urns, one placed in the Jokhang Temple in Lhasa for identifying the reincarnations of the grand Living Buddhas in Xizang; the other is placed in the Yonghegong Lama Temple in Beijing and used to identify the reincarnations of the grand Living Buddhas in various parts of Mongolia and the Tibetan-inhabited areas of Gansu and Qinghai provinces.\n\nTherefore, the golden urn lot-drawing system ensures that the reincarnations and successions of the grand Living Buddhas of Tibetan Buddhism are carried out under standardized and orderly conditions, effectively avoiding jobbery and collusion between ecclesiastical and secular forces. It has had a profound and far-reaching impact on maintaining the purity and dignity of the Living Buddha reincarnation system and stabilizing the social order in Mongolian and Tibetan-inhabited areas. It is the result of conforming to the trend of historical development.\n\nII. The golden urn lot-drawing system is widely supported and recognized by the Tibetan Buddhism community\n\nThe establishment of the golden urn lot-drawing system has hitherto been sincerely supported and actively practiced by the upper echelons of the Gelug Sect, including the Eighth Dalai Lama. After the issuance of the “Ordinance,” the Eighth Dalai Lama explicitly expressed his support for it and translated the text into Tibetan for publication across Xizang. In the subsequently issued proclamation for the Year of Water Buffalo, the Eighth Dalai Lama praised the golden urn lot-drawing system as the supreme grace of the central government to the monks and laymen of Xizang and the Gelug Sect, emphasizing the significance of this system for promoting Gelug and loving the people. At the same time, it was also clearly stated that after the implementation of the lot-drawing system, anyone who violates the regulations and selects the reincarnations willfully according to old customs will be severely punished. This proclamation not only demonstrated the respect of the Eighth Dalai Lama and the upper echelons of the Gelug Sect for the authority of the central government, but also showed their firm stance on maintaining the seriousness and purity of religious rituals, setting an example for various sects of Tibetan Buddhism to follow the system.\n\nExcept for the Eighth Dalai Lama, many of the Gelug Sect Living Buddhas have demonstrated their recognition of the golden urn lot-drawing system through their actions. For instance, when the Qing court formulated the golden urn lot-drawing system, it took into account the distance between Lhasa and regions such as Chamdo, and permitted the recognition of reincarnations in those areas to proceed according to old practices. Nevertheless, the monasteries in Chamdo willingly undertook the arduous journey to Lhasa to conduct the golden urn lot-drawing ceremony. Under the leadership of the Living Buddha Pagbalha of Chamdo’s Galden Jampaling Monastery, reincarnations of major Living Buddhas from places such as Riwoqê and Chagyab traveled to Lhasa for the golden urn lot-drawing, fully reflecting the Tibetan Buddhist community’s acceptance of the ceremony. This voluntary practice clearly shows that from the moment the golden urn lot-drawing ceremony was introduced, it received widespread recognition within Tibetan Buddhist communities. The fairness, sanctity, and authority of the central government embodied in the system were highly acknowledged. After over 200 years of development, the system has become deeply rooted among both the religious and secular communities in Xizang.\n\nIn addition, at the request of the Dalai Lama and the Gaxag government, several important golden urn lot-drawing ceremonies during the Qing Dynasty — for selecting the reincarnations of the Dalai Lama and Panchen Erdeni — were held in front of the memorial tablet of Emperor Kangxi and the portrait of Emperor Qianlong in the Potala Palace. This demonstrates the high regard and reverence the government of Xizang held for the central government and the golden urn lot-drawing system.\n\nSuch support was not accidental, but rather the result of multiple factors. On the religious level, the golden urn lot-drawing ceremony inherited and standardized the traditional Tibetan Buddhist method of “divine judgment,” aligning with the doctrine of “the Buddha’s decision through dharma,” thereby ensuring the sanctity of the recognition process for reincarnations, meeting the religious inheritance needs of the various Tibetan Buddhist sects. On the political level, understanding the importance of the central government’s authority in helping maintain its influence in Xizang, the upper echelons of the Gelug Sect selected reincarnations by drawing lots from the golden urn and submitted the results for the central government’s approval, conferring upon the reincarnations the legitimacy granted by the central government. On the social level, the system effectively curbed the social tensions and religious disorder caused by aristocratic manipulation and fraud in the old reincarnation practices, which strongly preserved social order in Xizang and are in line with the fundamental interests of all Tibetan Buddhist sects and the broader public.\n\nIII. The golden urn lot-drawing ceremony is the only path for recognizing the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama\n\nSince the establishment of the golden urn lot-drawing system, the reincarnations of the Dalai Lama from the Ninth to the 14th, as well as many grand Living Buddhas from other sects of Tibetan Buddhism, have been confirmed either through the golden urn lot-drawing ceremony or, in some cases, exemption from the ceremony with approval from the central government.\n\nAfter the reincarnation of the Eighth Dalai Lama was identified, the Gaxag government of Xizang — led by the regent Jedrung Hutuktu — submitted a petition in the name of all the monks and laymen of Xizang, requesting exemption from the golden urn lot-drawing ceremony. The Qing Dynasty government granted this request as an exception. However, after the Ninth Dalai Lama passed away, the Gaxag government, with the regent Demo Hutuktu and others, again requested an exemption from the golden urn lot-drawing ceremony for the reincarnation, which the Qing Dynasty government did not permit. Emperor Jiaqing sternly rebuked the request, stating that the exemption granted for the reincarnation of the Eighth Dalai Lama was a special case, and firmly reaffirmed the principle that the recognition of a Dalai Lama’s reincarnation must follow the golden urn lot-drawing procedure. Ultimately, on the 15th day of the first Lunar month in the second year of the Emperor Daoguang’s reign (1822), the first-ever golden urn lot-drawing ceremony for the Dalai Lama’s reincarnation was held, with Khenpo Kelzang Gyatso chosen as the reincarnation of the Ninth Dalai Lama. With the approval of the Qing government, he was formally enthroned at the Potala Palace as the 10th Dalai Lama. Thereafter, both the 11th and 12th Dalai Lamas were selected through the golden urn lot-drawing ceremony and formally enthroned with the approval of the central government. In the first year of the Emperor Guangxu’s reign (1875), the 12th Dalai Lama passed away. The following year, the local government of Xizang submitted a formal petition to the Imperial Commissioner in Xizang, bearing the seals and signatures of the Kalöns, major Hutuktus, and Khenpos of the three great monasteries, respectfully requesting an exemption from the lot-drawing procedure. After the Imperial Commissioner reported the matter to the central government of Qing Dynasty, the exemption was approved, and the candidate was officially recognized as the 13th Dalai Lama.\n\nIn 1933, following the passing of the 13th Dalai Lama, the Nationalist Government, then the central authorities of China, sent representative Huang Musong to Xizang to offer official condolences. In 1936, it issued a set of measures on the reincarnation of Living Buddhas. The regulations inherited Qing Dynasty’s approach to governing Xizang by managing the reincarnation of Living Buddhas through legal means, clearly defining the scope of reincarnation, the reporting procedures for reincarnations, and the recognition process for different levels of Living Buddhas. The regulations reaffirmed key principles such as confirming reincarnations through drawing lots from the golden urn and having central government representatives to preside over the enthronement of grand Living Buddhas.\n\nIn 1938, the regent Reting Rinpoche of Xizang submitted a petition to the central government requesting that the reincarnation of the 13th Dalai Lama be exempted from the golden urn lot-drawing. After negotiations with the local authorities of Xizang, the Nationalist Government proposed conditions for the exemption: first, Wu Zhongxin, chief of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission of the Nationalist Government, must personally travel to Xizang to verify whether the boy truly exhibited spiritual signs; second, Reting Rinpoche must formally submit a written request to the central government to officially seek exemption from the golden urn lot-drawing procedure. On February 5, 1940, the Nationalist Government issued an order approving Lhamo Thondup as the reincarnation of the 13th Dalai Lama, exempting him from the golden urn lot-drawing ceremony, and specially authorizing him to succeed as the 14th Dalai Lama. On February 22, Wu Zhongxin and Reting Rinpoche jointly presided over the enthronement ceremony of the 14th Dalai Lama. These historical facts demonstrate that the legitimacy of the 14th Dalai Lama also derived from the approval of the central government.\n\nNot only is this true for the lineage of the Dalai Lamas, but also for the lineages of other grand Living Buddhas, such as the Gelug sect’s Panchen Erdeni, the Jebtsundamba Khutuktu, the Jamyang Hutuktu, as well as those of the Karma Kagyu Sect’s Black Hat Living Buddhas and the Nyingma Sect’s Dojezhak Living Buddha — all of whom had their reincarnations selected through the golden urn lot-drawing ceremony. History fully demonstrates that the central government, in accordance with the law, holds the final approval authority over the recognition of reincarnations. The selection of a reincarnated Dalai Lama through drawing lots from the golden urn and subsequent approval by the central government is the only path for confirming the Dalai Lama’s reincarnation.\n\nA review of history clearly shows that the system of the golden urn lot-drawing ceremony was an important measure adopted by the Qing Dynasty central government to eliminate malpractice in the recognition process of reincarnations in Tibetan Buddhism and improve the reincarnation system of Living Buddhas. This measure not only reflected the central government’s respect for Tibetan Buddhism and its followers, but also demonstrated its authority in matters concerning the reincarnation of grand Living Buddhas such as the Dalai Lama. It remains a fundamental principle that must be upheld in the reincarnation of grand Living Buddhas in Tibetan Buddhism. ■",

    "content": "SummaryHong Kong proposes registration system for same-sex couplesRegistrants have to be married or registered overseasActivist questions fairness of overseas rule\n\nHONG KONG, July 2 (Reuters) - The Hong Kong government is proposing to establish a registration system for same-sex couples who are married or registered overseas to receive legal recognition, according to an official document released on Wednesday.\n\nThe proposal - detailed in a government paper to be discussed in Hong Kong's legislative council on Thursday - comes after Hong Kong's top court in September 2023 partially approved a landmark appeal by an LGBTQ activist for recognition of same-sex marriages.\n\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\n\nThe judges dismissed activist Jimmy Sham's appeal that he had a constitutional right to a same-sex marriage in Hong Kong, but gave the government two years to ensure that rights such as access to hospitals and inheritance could be protected for same-sex couples.\n\nResponding to the judgment, the government document proposed the new registration system to essentially allow a same-sex couple's partnership to be legally recognized.\n\nIt stipulates that both partners must be of the same sex and at least 18 years old, with at least one being a Hong Kong resident.\n\nThey would have rights related to medical matters concerning their partner, including hospital visits, access to medical information and organ donations, as well as the right to handle a partner's post-death affairs, including applying for a death certificate, claiming the body and arranging funeral matters.\n\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\n\nSame-sex couples applying for legal recognition under the proposed mechanism must have registered a valid same-sex marriage, civil partnership or civil union overseas.\n\nACTIVIST QUESTIONS EQUALITY\n\nIn Asia, only a few places including Taiwan, Nepal and Thailand currently allow same-sex unions, as the region's largely conservative values still dominate politics and society.\n\nThe Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau wrote in the paper that the proposed new system - which requires legislative approval - had taken into account Hong Kong's current social system and traditional values while seeking to avoid social divisions.\n\n\"It is essential to establish appropriate registration requirements under an alternative framework that aligns with practical realities and public expectations, while safeguarding registrants' rights and preventing abuse,\" the bureau wrote.\n\nAd Break Coming Up \n\n NEXT StayNext\n\nOffEnglish \n\n 180p288p360p480p540p576p720pHD1080pHDAuto (180p) \n\nAbout ConnatixV593333 \nAbout ConnatixV593333 \n\nContinue watchingafter the adVisit Advertiser websiteGO TO PAGE\n\nBut Sham, who first challenged the government in court, said the proposal offered a minimal level of protection, especially the stipulation that couples needed to be married abroad.\n\n\"(This) doesn't seem to meet the conditions of equality in registration,\" Sham told Reuters. \"I doubt it fully complies with what the judge required.\"\n\nReporting by Jessie Pang and James Pomfret; Editing by Andrew Heavens, James Pomfret and Jan Harvey\n\nPurchase Licensing Rights\n\nJessie PangThomson ReutersJessie Pang is a breaking news correspondent at Reuters, where she focuses on politics and general news in Hong Kong as well as breaking news in China.

    "title": "Hundreds of Haitians in Maine face potential deportation as Trump administration ends legal protections",
    "content": "Hundreds of Haitians living in Maine under temporary protected status may soon face the possibility of deportations after the federal government announced it will revoke legal protections for those fleeing civil war and natural disasters, which have ravaged the country in recent decades.\n\nThe termination of temporary protected status, or TPS, will affect some 500,000 Haitians in the U.S. legally, at least 200 of whom are in Maine, according to the Immigrant Legal Advocacy Project.\n\nTPS allows people to live in the U.S. when their homelands are made unsafe by wars or natural disasters. It has been given to immigrants from countries marred by civil conflict like Afghanistan or rocked by natural disasters like Nepal. The Trump administration has terminated TPS for both of those countries as well.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security posted a formal notice Tuesday that it is terminating TPS for Haiti effective Sept. 2, saying in a memo that while the country is still consumed by violent conflict, “it is contrary to the national interest to permit Haitian nationals (or aliens having no nationality who last habitually resided in Haiti) to remain temporarily in the United States.”\n\n“Gang violence in Haiti persists as armed groups operate with impunity, enabled by a weak or effectively absent central government,” the memo reads. “This breakdown in governance directly impacts U.S. national security interests, particularly in the context of uncontrolled migration.”\n\nThe government’s decision to end TPS implies that Haiti is safe enough for immigrants to return to, said Sue Roche, executive director of the ILAP. But she said the State Department’s own travel advisories contradict that notion, as the agency warns against travel to Haiti because of the risk of mob killings and gang-related kidnappings.\n\nRoche said she believes the decision is based more in racial bias than in reality.\n\n“For the Trump administration to claim that conditions in Haiti are anything but catastrophic and life-threatening is absurd,” Roche said in a written statement. “The termination of TPS for Haiti shows the extent of the administration’s disrespect for our laws, racial animus, and abject cruelty, and it places the lives of Maine residents at risk.”\n\nHaiti has been under TPS since a massive earthquake rocked the island nation in 2010. It has remained under the designation ever since, as civil wars, hurricanes and more earthquakes have torn through the country.\n\nWhile the DHS memo acknowledges Haiti’s “concerning” situation, it emphasizes that the U.S. must “prioritize its national interests,” and extending the legal protections to Haitians run counter to that, the administration says. DHS advised TPS holders to return to Haiti using a mobile application called CBP Home, according to the Associated Press.\n\n“DHS records indicate that there are Haitian nationals who are TPS recipients who have been the subject of administrative investigations for fraud, public safety, and national security. These issues underscore a conflict with the national interest of the United States,” the agency wrote.\n\nThe TPS designation provides broader and more accessible protections for immigrants than the established asylum system, according to ILAP policy director Lisa Parisio.\n\nWhile asylum applicants must prove their lives are in personal danger due to the threat of persecution for their race, politics or other protected grounds, TPS broadly provides legal protections to entire nationalities.\n\nBut TPS applies only to people already in the U.S. “at the time that something catastrophic happens in their home country which makes it impossible for them to safely return,” Parisio said.\n\n“Following the aftermath of World War II, the United States made promises through various international treaties that we would never again return people to countries where their lives or freedom would be at risk. So TPS is one of the main humanitarian programs in our immigration system,” Parisio said.\n\nPresident Donald Trump campaigned on a pledge to ramp up mass deportations, in part by scaling back TPS protections. Trump highlighted Haitian immigrants in particular when he claimed without evidence during a presidential debate that they were abducting and eating pets in Ohio.\n\nRevoking TPS could also affect Maine’s blueberry farms and Christmas tree industry, the ILAP said in a press release, both of which rely on Haitian immigrants for seasonal work each year.\n\nMaine nonprofits that do humanitarian work in Haiti have also been forced to scale back their work funding maternal and child care facilities after the administration revoked hundreds of thousands of dollars they received in USAID grants.\n\n“With the stroke of a pen, an entire community will suffer. Others will step in to try to help, but they won’t be able to fill the void. These women and children will suffer,” Perry Newman, executive director of nonprofit Konbit Sante, said at the time in February. “Many lives will be changed, and sadly, some lives will be lost.”",

    "title": "Death, Betrayal & Shocking Allegations: Hun Sen's Revelations",
    "content": "BANGKOK, Thailand -- In a spectacular and dangerous political breakup between Asia's two most powerful de facto leaders, Cambodia's Hun Sen publicly ended his \"betrayed\" friendship with Thailand's Thaksin Shinawatra and, in revenge over their deadly border dispute, said Mr. Thaksin allegedly duped Bangkok's judicial authorities by wearing a neck brace and arm sling as fake props to avoid prison.\n\nCambodian Senate President Hun Sen livestreamed his bombshell allegations which shocked Thais and sharply increased the political vulnerability of Bangkok's teetering coalition government headed by Mr. Thaksin and his daughter, Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra.\n\n\"Now that I’ve been betrayed, I feel I must reveal what the Thaksin family did to betray their nation,\" Mr. Hun Sen said on June 27 at a local government meeting.\n\nDirecting his anger and allegations at Mr. Thaksin, Mr. Hun Sen warned: “If you act arrogantly, I will expose everything you told me.\n\n\"Discipline your children. You have a child as prime minister, and I have a child as prime minister. But don’t mistake me for someone you can cross.\n\n“I regret that a 30-year friendship was destroyed by a friend's daughter,\" Mr. Hun Sen said, referring to Ms. Paetongtarn.\n\nMr. Hun Sen's official Facebook page, which has 14 million followers, is also filled with anger, accusations, and dismay about Mr. Thaksin and his daughter.\n\nTheir surprise breakup began when Thailand and Cambodia became embroiled in a brief clash, which killed a Cambodian soldier on May 28 along their disputed frontier in the jungle and scrubland of the Emerald Triangle where eastern Thailand, northern Cambodia, and southern Laos meet.\n\nBoth sides blamed each other for politicizing the feud and whipping up aggressive nationalism, which escalated throughout June into border closures and boycotts of imports and exports, despite the supposedly deep personal friendship between the two nations' dynastic ruling families.\n\n\"All I want is an equal relationship built on mutual respect, with no encroachment and no intervention,\" Mr. Hun Sen said, referring to their border feud.\n\nEach side blames the other for initiating hostilities on the frontier.\n\nThe twice-elected Mr. Thaksin, who will be 76 years old in July, is one of Thailand's most powerful civilian political leaders.\n\nHe is widely perceived as ruling this Southeast Asian, Buddhist-majority, U.S. treaty ally through his pliant 38-year-old daughter, Ms. Paetongtarn.\n\nThai media describe Mr. Thaksin as the \"de facto boss of the Pheu Thai Party\" which is officially led by his daughter atop an uneasy ruling coalition which includes pro-military parties.\n\nMr. Hun Sen, 72, was one of Pol Pot's anti-U.S. Khmer Rouge regiment commanders during the 1970s and, after defecting to Vietnam, became Cambodia's authoritarian prime minister for 38 years.\n\nIn 2023, he orchestrated his son Mr. Hun Manet, 47 and a West Point graduate, to become the country's current prime minister.\n\n\"I flew to Bangkok to visit Thaksin. He was not ill at all,\" Mr. Hun Sen said describing events last year.\n\n\"When it came time to take [media] photos, he asked for props -- a neck brace, an arm brace -- to appear unwell. As soon as the photos were done, he removed them and went to dine,\" he said, according to the conservative Bangkok Post's translation of Mr. Hun Sen's Khmer language livestream.\n\n\"That's not illness, that's theater. Thai people already have suspicions. I am only confirming what many have thought, because both Thaksin and his daughter, Paetongtarn, are acting in bad faith,\" Mr. Hun Sen said in his meeting with local Cambodian government officials.\n\nThai politicians, investigators, and the media suspected Mr. Thaksin, who voluntarily returned to Thailand in 2023, avoided being confined to a jail cell by allegedly faking severe illness, enabling him to spend months in a hospital before being released.\n\nHe had been sentenced to several years in prison, later pardoned down to only one year, for financial corruption committed during his 2001-06 administration.\n\nA government photograph of Mr. Hun Sen meeting Mr. Thaksin and Ms. Paetongtarn on Feb. 21, 2024 in Bangkok shows the two men sitting on a sofa next to each other with Mr. Thaksin's neck swathed in a thick wraparound circular medical neck collar and a reinforced black sling on his right arm, with refreshments on the table in front of them.\n\nMr. Thaksin had also appeared in Thailand at events while wearing what appeared to be the same neck brace and arm sling, including when he was sitting next to a swimming pool.\n\nThais filled social media with criticism and mocking memes about those appearances, because they were convinced he was faking illnesses for leniency in several pending court cases.\n\nIn 2006, Mr. Thaksin was toppled by the U.S.-trained military in a bloodless coup and stayed overseas for 15 years dodging prison sentences for financial corruption during his administration.\n\nBased mostly in Dubai, the fugitive arranged for his sister Yingluck Shinawatra to be elected prime minister in 2011 as another pliant political proxy, but her government was ousted in a 2014 military coup.\n\nMs. Yingluck is currently in self-exile, sometimes in England, dodging prison sentences for financial mismanagement involving her government's rice subsidies.\n\nWhile Mr. Thaksin avoided being caught in Thailand, Mr. Hun Sen named him as an \"adviser\" to Cambodia's government and openly appeared to be personally supportive.\n\nIn his livestream, Mr. Hun Sen claimed Ms. Paetongtarn allegedly confided her plans when she maneuvered against one of her coalition government's political rivals.\n\n\"Even when you planned to remove Anutin Charnvirakul [on June 19] from his posts as deputy prime minister and interior minister, you told me,\" Mr. Hun Sen said.\n\n\"If you can betray your own citizens, why would you not dare betray me? Of course you would.\"\n\nMeanwhile, more than 10,000 anti-Thaksin, pro-military protesters gathered in Bangkok's grimy streets at Victory Monument on June 28 demanding Ms. Paetongtarn resign because of her seemingly cringing phone call to Mr. Hun Sen on June 15 which was leaked, including her disparaging criticism of Thailand's Second Army Region Commander Lt. Gen. Boonsin Padklang.\n\nLt. Gen. Boonsin's forces guard northeastern Thailand's entire border with Cambodia, including the disputed Emerald Triangle where the Cambodian soldier was shot dead.\n\nIn the audio of her leaked call -- which she later confirmed -- Ms. Paetongtarn told Mr. Hun Sen that she did not want him \"to listen to the opposing side, especially since the [Thai] Second Army Region commander is entirely from the opposition.\n\n“He [the Thai commander] just wants to appear cool or impressive. He may say things that are not beneficial to the country,” Ms. Paetongtarn reportedly said in Thai to Mr. Hun Sen's translator during her call.\n\nAs a result of her telephone remarks, Ms. Paetongtarn faces Bangkok's politically powerful Constitutional Court on July 1 when it is expected to decide if it will accept a petition claiming she violated the constitution, threatened Thailand's security and must be ousted, signed by 36 pro-military senators.\n\nIf the court accepts the case, she could be removed immediately or be allowed to remain as a caretaker prime minister while the court hears her case, which could take several weeks or months.\n\n\"The judges will assess whether [her] continued occupancy of the premiership, even for a day or two, could pose a credible risk,\" legal scholar Jade Donavanik told the Bangkok Post.\n\n\"If there is a reasonable suspicion that such a risk exists, then remaining in office would be untenable,\" Mr. Jade said.\n\nMs. Paetongtarn's next test comes two days later on July 3 when she faces a no-confidence vote in parliament where she has a slim majority after pro-military Bhumjaithai (Proud to be Thai) Party leader Anutin Charnvirakul quit her coalition government and moved his 69 parliamentarians into the opposition.\n\nThe National Anti-Corruption Commission, the Election Commission, and the Central Investigation Bureau are separately due to also hear allegations that her conversation with Mr. Hun Sen may have violated the constitution and threatened Thailand's security.\n\nDuring Saturday's (June 28) street demonstration, the protesters did not explicitly call for a coup, but some indicated they would support a putsch if Ms. Paetongtarn refused to resign.\n\n“If the military wants to do something during a national crisis, go ahead, but let the selection of the prime minister involve public participation,” said prominent protest leader Sondhi Limthongkul.\n\nIn 2008, Mr. Sondhi led pro-military, royalist Yellow Shirt supporters to shut down Bangkok's two international airports, stranding tens of thousands of travelers for more than a week, in a protest to topple Mr. Thaksin's brother-in-law Prime Minister Somchai Wongsawat.\n\nThe royalist anti-Thaksin leader of the Thai Pakdee Party, Warong Dechgitvigrom, told protesters: “We are facing a prime minister with the DNA of a traitor, while our soldiers protect national sovereignty.\"\n\n\"I filed a complaint against Hun Sen under Thai law,\" because the Cambodian leader recorded and leaked an official call, said Somkid Chueakhong, deputy secretary-general to the prime minister for political affairs.\n\n\"The next step is for the case to proceed as a special investigation. After the investigation, it will be submitted to the attorney-general.\n\n\"If Hun Sen fails to appear, a summons will be issued, followed by an arrest warrant,\" Mr. Somkid said.\n\nRichard S.

    "title": "As media bemoans Albanese’s tricky Trump relationship, our South-East Asian neighbours remain invisible",
    "content": "There was a comical amount of media coverage about Prime Minister Anthony Albanese’s will-he-won’t-he meeting with US President Donald Trump at the recent G7 conference in Canada. Then there was the kerfuffle about the PM’s non-attendance at the NATO meeting last week.\n\nThat has now extended to Penny Wong’s visit to Washington for this week’s Quad meeting (with the US, India and Japan), but ironically lost in all the white noise has been the government’s failure to deliver on its promise of better engagement with Asia. \n\nWhen the Labor government took office in 2022, one of its early initiatives — set out by Wong in a landmark July 2022 speech in Singapore — was to set out a (well overdue) plan to better engage with Australia’s Asian neighbours, especially our closest neighbour in South-East Asia.\n\n“Our trade is not keeping pace with growth, and it is insufficiently diversified to maximise benefit. Our investment is similarly underweight,” she said, highlighting the fact that Australia’s direct investment in South-East Asia had declined both in relative and absolute terms since 2014, despite the region’s significant economic growth.\n\nThe US (2), UK (8), New Zealand (7) and Germany (13) are the only non-Asian nations in Australia’s top 15 trading partners. The list includes, in descending order: China (1), Japan (3), South Korea (4), India (5), Singapore (6), Thailand (9), Malaysia (10), Indonesia (11), Taiwan (12), Vietnam (14) and Hong Kong (15).\n\nEmphasising a new approach, Wong underscored the importance of listening and mutual respect:\n\n“People appreciate the energy. People appreciate the engagement. People appreciate the willingness to listen, and I want to approach this job being able to listen and not just to tell people what we think they should do,” she said during a 2022 trip to Malaysia.\n\n“Though we are tied together by geography, the human ties of family, business, education and tourism are stronger. Australia wants to strengthen these ties further,” Wong wrote in Crikey in the same year.\n\nYet more than three years in, the Albanese government’s record — beyond its admirable repairing of ties with China and the set-piece pilgrimage to Indonesia after each election win — on drawing closer and gaining a better understanding of our region remains somewhat wanting. \n\n“Most Labor governments come into office with good intentions about Asia generally, and South-East Asia particularly. But then they discover that: one, it’s a bit hard, because no matter what they might think, they have slightly different world views. And secondly, of course, there’s always the law and attraction that Paris is a much nicer place to visit than [Cambodian capital] Phnom Penh,” one former senior diplomat told Crikey. \n\nAnother critique levelled at the government by a number of former Asian envoys, who spoke to Crikey on the condition of anonymity, is the diplomatic lurch back towards the South Pacific. This was made by the Coalition government under Scott Morrison’s South Pacific “Step-Up”, suddenly alert to rising — and from Beijing’s point of view, understandable — Chinese influence in the region. This involved $3 billion in aid and investment and a rerouting of resources in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. \n\nOne diplomat described this as an “imbalance” that remains, continuing to thwart resources and engagement better directed to South-East Asia. “Yes, the South Pacific is important, but ASEAN is where all that is — where the people [about 700 million of them] and the money is.”\n\nThe key players at the frontline of diplomatic and strategic efforts are the PM, Wong, Trade Minister Don Farrell and Defence Minister Richard Marles. It is little surprise that the latter has been so deep in AUKUS that he has had little time for the rest of the region, save for generally one visit to each country in the past three years, many coinciding with regional summits.\n\nIndeed, the end-of-year summit season — including ASEAN and the East Asia Summit — has provided an opportunity for leaders to tick off relative minnows Cambodia (2022) and Laos (2024), with Indonesia hosting in 2023. Beyond that, visits by senior government ministers have been perfunctory at best.\n\n“It’s hard to know what they see — when they do go — beyond hotels, receptions and meeting rooms,” one former diplomat said.\n\nTimor-Leste, a country whose independence Australia fought for both diplomatically and literally as it transitioned from an Indonesian colony to the region’s newest nation, has been increasingly ignored.\n\n“Sometimes it seems like Canberra thinks that the Timorese are not thankful enough to us,” a former diplomat with deep experience in the region said. Wong visited Dili in 2022 and 2023, but Albanese has not bothered.\n\nDespite the obvious and necessary importance of and attention paid to India, the rest of South Asia has largely been ignored by senior government members, with no visit to Nepal — Australia’s third largest source of international students — or Bangladesh, and only Wong visiting Sri Lanka.\n\nThe other key element that former diplomats noted was the drop-off in visits to the region by other cabinet ministers, especially Home Affairs. The Australian Federal Police have a significant presence across the region working on drug and people trafficking, and has staff based in Cambodia, China (Beijing and Guangzhou), Hong Kong, India, Myanmar, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Vietnam (Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City). Australia draws most of its international students from Asia.\n\n“We are not nearly as good as we used to be at building these relationships,” one former envoy said. “Asian leaders in all sectors really value face time.”\n\nLike a conga line of governments before it — diplomats remember with some disdain Julia Gillard’s “Australia in the Asian Century” white paper that was promptly buried by Tony Abbott — Albanese’s has commissioned yet another report on the region. This time, he tapped former Macquarie chief Nicholas Moore, whose own experience of the region is thin, for the grandly named Invested: Australia’s South-East Asia Economic Strategy to 2040.\n\nThis falls into a recent critique of Health Minister Mark Butler by a senior public servant, that the government needs “more doing and less reviewing”. Former diplomats and a number of businesspeople with deep Asian experience were generally dismissive of the report and its follow-up.\n\nThe relative failure to step up engagement with Asia is not only with regard to trade and defence, but to conflict as well. While the war in Ukraine and the Israel-Gaza conflict have been given an enormous amount of attention by the government, devastating civil wars in Myanmar have not.\n\nIndeed, in light of the human suffering it has inflicted and public opprobrium that the vile junta in Myanmar deserves, the key roles being played in Myanmar by both the Chinese and Russian governments should also be given plenty of attention. Myanmar’s junta chief Min Aung Hlaing has now been to Moscow three times this year, and on his last trip met Chinese leader Xi Jinping. As we saw during the election, Russia continues to try to wield influence in the Indo-Pacific beyond its arms sales with aid for a base in Indonesia. That failed, but its involvement in Myanmar has been barely noted in Australia.\n\n“I appreciate that the war in Gaza is something of profound interest to a lot of people in Australia, as is the Ukraine. Of course, we can both walk and chew gum. It’s possible to be engaged with Myanmar as well, especially because of where Myanmar is and its relationship to the world around it. After all, we are a neighbour across the Indian Ocean — it really depresses how little attention we give it,” a former Myanmar envoy said. He noted that the days of Australia really stepping up — as it did in Cambodia in the early 1990s, Timor-Leste at the turn of the century, and the Solomon Islands in the 2000s — seem the actions of a different country.",

But the episode has infuriated many voters and could also have a \"long-term impact on relations\" between Thailand and Cambodia, said The Telegraph.\n\nWhat are the origins of the dispute?\nFrench colonial administrators created the border in 1907, when Cambodia was part of French Indochina. The 508-mile border was meant to follow the \"natural watershed line\" between the two countries, said Reuters. but Thailand (which was known as Siam until 1939) contested what it saw as incursions into historically Thai territory.\nDuring the Second World War, when Japan occupied French Indochina, control of the disputed areas was briefly returned to Thailand, but the pre-war borders were reinstated after Japan's defeat.\nThere have been numerous attempts to clear up the dispute, including the establishment of the Joint Boundary Commission in 2000, but so far they have failed to make significant headway. However, until this year, there had not been any military clashes over the border since 2011.\nWhy has it flared up recently?\nTensions spiked in May when a skirmish between Thai and Cambodian forces in a disputed area of the border left a Cambodian soldier dead. The Cambodian government accused Thai soldiers of opening fire on one of its long-standing military posts on the border. The Thai government, however, claimed its troops were defending themselves after Cambodian soldiers opened fire.\nEven before then, tensions had been simmering. In February, Cambodian troops and their families filmed themselves singing the Cambodian national anthem inside Ta Moan Thom, one of several temples in the disputed territory. The incident went viral on social media.\nHow have both countries reacted? \nThe rising hostilities have led to retaliatory actions between the two countries. Thailand has closed off land crossings to Cambodia multiple times in recent months, heavily impacting trade as well as halting the flow of gamblers flocking to Cambodia's border town casinos. In response, Cambodia has banned some imports from Thailand, including films and TV shows, as well as fruits and vegetables, and electricity.\nThailand's Department of Foreign Trade has warned that the impact on trade between the neighbouring nations could cost the country 60 billion baht (£22.5 million) if disruption continues until the end of the year, said the Bangkok Post.\nWill it bring down the Thai government?\nPaetongtarn is part of the Shinawatra dynasty, a family with long-standing influence in Thai politics (her father Thaksin and her aunt Yingluck are both former prime ministers).\nThe family has previously had good relations with Hun Sen, who remains Cambodia's de facto leader despite officially ceding power to his son in 2023, but the leaked phone call has put Paetongtarn's premiership on shaky ground.\nIn response to the phone call, the conservative Bhumjaithai Party said it would be pulling out of its coalition with Paetongtarn's centre-left Pheu Thai party, leaving her with little chance of staying in power. Paetongtarn will face a vote of no confidence in parliament on 3 July.\nMeanwhile, Thailand’s constitutional court will convene tomorrow to consider a suit alleging that the phone call amounted to treason, a case with \"potentially explosive\" ramifications, said the Thai Examiner.\n\nExplore More\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox\nA free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nRichard Windsor, The Week UK\n\nSocial Links Navigation\n\nRichard Windsor is a freelance writer for The Week Digital.

This collision generates immense pressure and stress, which is released as earthquakes. Nepal is also situated in a subduction zone where the Indian Plate is sliding beneath the Eurasian Plate, further increasing stress and strain.\nNepal lies in the Himalayan region, a zone of intense seismic activity caused by the ongoing collision of the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates. This collision results in the Indian plate pushing beneath the Eurasian plate in a process called subduction, creating immense pressure and strain on the Earth's crust.\nThe subduction zone further amplifies the stress, making Nepal highly vulnerable to earthquakes. The collision also contributes to the uplift of the Himalayan mountains, adding to the overall seismic activity in the region.\nNepal has a long history of earthquakes, including devastating events like the 2015 earthquake.\nEarlier on April 26, Nepali Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli stood below the replica of Dharahara Tower that fell down on April 25 2015 and observed a minute's silence for 8,969 victims who lost their lives in the devastating earthquake of 7.8 Richter scale.

    "content": "IF all goes as planned, Nepal will begin exporting buffalo meat to China next June, with a daily target of 5,000 tonnes, according to meat industry representatives.\n\n“It’s been a week since we received approval for Chinese investment worth nearly Rs9.5 billion. The investors are arriving this Sunday, after which we’ll submit an application to the Investment Board Nepal for final approval,” said Navin Kumar Sharma, chairman of Himalayan Food International.\n\nThe investment for the ambitious project will be delivered in three phases. Last December, China expanded trade opportunities beyond traditional handicrafts —Nepal’s primary export to its northern neighbour for decades — by opening its market to water buffalo meat. This development followed Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s official visit to China, during which Beijing agreed to allow meat imports from Nepal.\n\nOn December 16, 2023, Himalayan Food International, a Nepali private company, signed a business-to-business agreement in Kathmandu with China’s Shanghai Ziyan Food to export buffalo meat. Beijing has promoted the deal as part of its ‘soft trade diplomacy’ strategy and hopes to import up to $1.5 billion worth of buffalo meat annually from Nepal, calling the partnership a potential “game changer”.\n\nThe total Chinese investment in Nepal’s meat sector will reach around Rs27 billion, covering two major components: meat processing and animal rearing.\n\n“We would have already begun construction, but there was a delay on the Nepali government’s part in declaring a disease-free zone for livestock,” Sharma said. “The Chinese side waited for the official announcement before approving the funds.”\n\nAlthough the government had initially planned to send the required documents in December, they were only dispatched in June.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 30th, 2025",

    "title": "World News | Trump Calls for Deal on War in Gaza as Signs of Progress Emerge",
    "content": "Tel Aviv (Israel), Jun 29 (AP) US President Donald Trump on Sunday pleaded for progress in ceasefire talks in the war in Gaza, calling for a deal that would halt the fighting in the 20-month-long conflict as Israel and Hamas appeared to be inching closer to an agreement. A top adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Cabinet Minister Ron Dermer, was set to travel to Washington this week for talks on a ceasefire, an Israeli official said. Also Read | Earthquake in Nepal: Quake of Magnitude 4.2 on Richter Scale Hits South Asian Country. The official said plans also were being made for Netanyahu to travel to Washington in the coming weeks, a sign there may be movement on a new deal. The official declined to discuss the focus of the visit and spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss plans that had not yet been finalised. “MAKE THE DEAL IN GAZA. GET THE HOSTAGES BACK!!!” Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social early Sunday between posts about a Senate vote on his tax and spending cuts bill. Also Read | Salesforce Layoffs Coming? CEO Marc Benioff Says 50% of Work Now Done by AI, Highlights Major Shift Toward Automation at Workplace and Hints at Possible Job Cuts in Future. Trump raised expectations Friday for a deal, saying there could be a ceasefire agreement within the next week. Taking questions from reporters, he said, “We're working on Gaza and trying to get it taken care of.\" Trump has repeatedly called for Israel and Hamas to end the war in Gaza. Despite an eight-week ceasefire reached just as Trump took office earlier this year, attempts since then to bring the sides toward a new agreement have failed. Trump post slams Netanyahu corruption trial The Gaza message wasn't the only Middle East-related post by Trump. On Saturday evening, he doubled down on his criticism of the legal proceedings against Netanyahu, who is on trial for alleged corruption, calling it “a POLITICAL WITCH HUNT, very similar to the Witch Hunt that I was forced to endure”. In the post on Truth Social, he said the trial interfered with talks on a Gaza ceasefire. “(Netanyahu) is right now in the process of negotiating a Deal with Hamas, which will include getting the Hostages back. How is it possible that the Prime Minister of Israel can be forced to sit in a Courtroom all day long, over NOTHING,” Trump wrote. The post echoed similar remarks Trump made last week when he called for the trial to be cancelled. It was a dramatic interference by an international ally in the domestic affairs of a sovereign state. And it unnerved many in Israel, despite Trump's popularity in the country. The trial has repeatedly been postponed at the request of Netanyahu, citing security and diplomatic developments. On Sunday, the court agreed to call off two more days of testimony by Netanyahu scheduled this week. A sticking point over how the war ends Talks between Israel and Hamas have repeatedly faltered over one major sticking point, whether the war should end as part of any ceasefire agreement. Hamas official Mahmoud Merdawi accused Netanyahu of stalling progress on a deal, saying in remarks on the Telegram messaging app that the Israeli leader insists on a temporary agreement that would free just 10 of the hostages. Netanyahu spokesperson Omer Dostri said “Hamas was the only obstacle to ending the war”, without addressing Merdawi's claim. Hamas says it is willing to free all the hostages in exchange for a full withdrawal of Israeli troops and an end to the war. Israel rejects that offer, saying it will agree to end the war if Hamas surrenders, disarms and goes into exile, something the group refuses. The war in Gaza began with October 7, 2023, attacks by Hamas in which militants killed 1,200 people and took roughly 250 hostage, about 50 of whom remain captive with less than half believed to be alive. Gaza's Health Ministry on Sunday said an additional 88 people were killed by Israeli fire over the past 24 hours, raising the death toll to 56,500 in over 20 months of fighting. The ministry, part of the Hamas government, does not distinguish between militants and civilians in their count but says more than half of the dead are women and children. The war has set off a humanitarian catastrophe, displaced most of Gaza's population, often multiple times, and obliterated much of the territory's urban landscape. Israeli military orders new evacuations in northern Gaza The Israeli military on Sunday ordered a mass evacuation of Palestinians in large swaths of northern Gaza, an early target of the war that has been severely damaged by multiple rounds of fighting. Col. Avichay Adraee, a military spokesperson, posted the order on social media. It includes multiple neighbourhoods in eastern and northern Gaza City, as well as the Jabaliya refugee camp. The military will expand its escalating attacks to the city's northern section, calling for people to move southward to the Muwasi area in southern Gaza, Adraee said. After being all but emptied earlier in the war, hundreds of thousands of people are in northern Gaza following their return during a ceasefire earlier this year. An Israeli military offensive currently underway aims to move Palestinians to southern Gaza so forces can more freely operate to combat militants. Rights groups say their movement would amount to forcible displacement.

    "content": "Kathmandu, June 29: An earthquake of magnitude 4.2 struck Nepal on Sunday, a statement by the National Center for Seismology (NCS) said. As per the NCS, the earthquake occurred at a shallow depth of 10km, making it susceptible to aftershocks. In a post on X, the NCS said, \"EQ of M: 4.2, On: 29/06/2025 14:19:05 IST, Lat: 29.35 N, Long: 81.94 E, Depth: 10 Km, Location: Nepal.\" Shallow earthquakes are more dangerous than deeper ones due to their greater energy release closer to the Earth's surface, causing stronger ground shaking and increased damage to structures and casualties, compared to deeper earthquakes, which lose energy as they travel to the surface. Earthquakes in Nepal: 2 Quakes of Magnitude 4.1 and 4 on Richter Scale Hit Baglung and Myagdi; No Casualties Reported. Nepal is highly earthquake-prone due to its location on a convergent boundary where the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates collide. This collision generates immense pressure and stress, which is released as earthquakes. Nepal is also situated in a subduction zone where the Indian Plate is sliding beneath the Eurasian Plate, further increasing stress and strain. Nepal lies in the Himalayan region, a zone of intense seismic activity caused by the ongoing collision of the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates. This collision results in the Indian plate pushing beneath the Eurasian plate in a process called subduction, creating immense pressure and strain on the Earth's crust. Earthquake in Nepal: Quake of Magnitude 5.0 on Richter Scale Hits Country, Light Tremors Felt in North India. The subduction zone further amplifies the stress, making Nepal highly vulnerable to earthquakes. The collision also contributes to the uplift of the Himalayan mountains, adding to the overall seismic activity in the region.nNepal has a long history of earthquakes, including devastating events like the 2015 earthquake. Earlier on April 26, a minute's silence was observed for 8,969 victims who lost their lives on April 25 2015, in the devastating earthquake of 7.8 Richter scale a decade ago.nStanding below the replica of Dharahara Tower that fell down during the earthquake a decade ago, killing dozens, Nepali Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli remembered those killed in the natural disaster.

    "title": "World News | Nepal's Ex-president Bidya Devi Bhandari Returns to Active Politics, Rejoins CPN-UML",
    "content": "Kathmandu, Jun 28 (PTI) Nepal's former president Bidya Devi Bhandari on Saturday announced that she has rejoined active politics by renewing her membership of the ruling CPN-UML, nearly a decade after she left the party to assume the country's top constitutional post. Bhandari, 62, made the announcement while addressing a programme organised in Kathmandu by the Madan Bhandari Foundation to mark the 74th birth anniversary of her late husband and former Communist Party of Nepal-Unified Marxist Leninist (CPN-UML) General Secretary Madan Bhandari. Also Read | US Senate Reduces Remittance Tax to 1% From 3.5% in Relief for NRIs. “I have renewed my membership of CPN-UML with an objective of giving continuity to the party's political journey,” Bhandari said at the function, which was also attended by Prime Minister K P Oli. Oli is also the incumbent chairman of CPN-UML. Also Read | Elon Musk Responds to Question on Jobs Cannot Be Automated by AI, Says 'There Will Be a Premium for Human Experiences'. “Now, I am reunited with the CPN-UML as a member of this family, and I feel proud of this,” Bhandari said. The former president's return to active politics comes amid growing speculation about her future role within the CPN-UML. Over the past few months, she has been holding interactions with party leaders and cadres across the country, fuelling rumours that she may be eyeing a larger role in party leadership. Political experts opine that Bhandari's decision to rejoin CPN-UML might pose a threat to Oli, who is enjoying \"a kind of monopoly\" in the ruling party. Quoting party insiders, The Kathmandu Post newspaper reported that Bhandari could challenge Oli in CPN-UML's next general convention. Oli, who has led the party since 2014, is said to be seeking a third term as chief. Speaking at the same event, Prime Minister Oli asserted that CPN-UML was united and warned against attempts to divide it. Without naming anyone, he said, “Do not dream of splitting the UML.” Oli also urged party members to focus on the next general elections, scheduled to be held in 2027-28. Adding to the political significance of her move, Bhandari recently undertook a 10-day visit to China from May 24, during which she held meetings with high-ranking officials. The visit drew attention in Nepal, with observers interpreting it as an effort to boost her political clout. Bhandari's re-entry into party politics has sparked debate in Nepal's political circles. It is not common for a former president to return to party politics, although there may be no legal restriction, senior journalist and political analyst Dhurva Hari Adhikary said. It may raise moral questions, even if it remains a personal decision, he added. Bhandari served as Nepal's president for two consecutive terms between 2015 and 2023. She had relinquished her party membership after being elected to the largely ceremonial post in October 2015, becoming the country's first woman head of state. Before her elevation to the presidency, Bhandari was a senior CPN-UML leader and had served as the party's vice-chairperson. She was also the defence minister in the Madhav Kumar Nepal-led government in 2009. Bhandari is the widow of Madan Bhandari, a popular Marxist leader who died in a controversial jeep accident in 1993. The incident was widely seen as suspicious, and investigations at the time failed to conclusively establish the cause of the crash.

    "title": "House of Representatives to Discuss Finance Bill Today",
    "content": "Nepal’s House of Representatives will hold a meeting today at 11:00 am at the Federal Parliament Building in New Baneshwor. The meeting is expected to focus on passing major financial and legislative bills. These include the Finance Bill, 2082, and the Bill to Raise National Debt, 2082. Both will be presented by Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Bishnu Prasad Paudel.\n\nThe Finance Bill outlines how the government plans to raise and spend public money in the coming fiscal year. It covers taxes, budget distribution, and funding plans for public projects. This bill is a key part of the national budget and must be passed before the new fiscal year begins. Minister Paudel is likely to explain the government’s spending strategy and goals for economic growth.\n\nThe Bill to Raise National Debt allows the government to borrow funds to cover budget gaps. Borrowing is often needed to manage large development projects or urgent expenses. This bill will help the government access loans and issue bonds to finance its plans. Lawmakers are expected to review the borrowing terms to ensure they support national interests without increasing financial risks.\n\nAnother important item on the agenda is the Nepal Citizenship (Second Amendment) Bill, 2082. The bill aims to revise the rules related to citizenship. Changes could affect how people apply for citizenship and the documents required. These updates may help solve long-standing issues faced by individuals who have lived in Nepal for years but lack legal status. General-Secretary of the Federal Parliament Secretariat, Padam Prasad Pandey, confirmed that this bill is part of today’s legislative focus.\n\nBesides the bills, the meeting will also include a briefing from Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli. He will inform lawmakers about his upcoming trip to Spain. The Prime Minister is set to leave this evening to attend the Fourth International Conference on Financing for Development. He will lead the Nepali delegation at the event.\n\nThis conference is a global platform where leaders discuss ways to fund development in poorer countries. It covers topics such as international aid, sustainable investment, and debt relief. By attending, Nepal hopes to build partnerships and gain support for its own development programs. Prime Minister Oli’s briefing is expected to give insight into Nepal’s goals for the event and how it could benefit the country’s economy.\n\nParliament meetings like today’s are important for shaping the nation’s future. Lawmakers will review, debate, and vote on laws that impact everyday life. With the Finance Bill on the table, the government’s economic plans will come under sharp focus. The decisions made today will affect how schools, hospitals, roads, and other services are funded over the next year.\n\nThe National Debt Bill, too, will be closely watched. As Nepal continues to invest in infrastructure and recovery programs, borrowing decisions must be carefully managed. Too much debt could strain the economy, but smart borrowing can boost growth. The Parliament will need to find a balance.\n\nCitizenship issues have also remained sensitive for many years. Delays in granting citizenship have left some people unable to access education, jobs, or even basic rights. The proposed changes may help address these concerns. Parliament’s debate on the amendment bill will be followed with interest by many families across the country.\n\nThe Prime Minister’s trip adds an international angle to the day’s agenda. His briefing offers a chance for lawmakers to ask questions about foreign policy, development finance, and Nepal’s global engagement. It also shows how domestic policy and international events are linked.\n\nToday’s House of Representatives meeting will play a key role in setting Nepal’s legal and financial direction. The outcome of the discussions will shape policy for the coming year and beyond. All eyes are on Parliament as it tackles these major issues in a single session.",

    "title": "India’s Monarchy Fantasy in Nepal Is a Strategic Mirage",
    "content": "In recent months, pro-monarchy demonstrations have flared across Nepal, with some protesters carrying posters of Indian Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. These symbolic gestures are not incidental. They signal a growing ideological intersection between Nepal’s royalist nostalgia and India’s rising Hindu nationalism. For some in India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) – and its ideological mentor, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) – the return of a Hindu monarchy in Nepal is being framed as both a civilizational triumph and a strategic necessity. But this vision is a dangerous misreading of Nepal’s history, its political complexities, and the implications for India’s regional interests. For India, the idea of a culturally aligned, Hindu-majority monarchy in Nepal appears attractive amid the growing Chinese presence in the region. Proponents argue that a Hindu king could serve as a bulwark against Beijing, foster cultural affinity, and stabilize a politically turbulent neighbor. This narrative has gained traction among Indian right-wing commentators and politicians alike, echoing similar ideological currents across the subcontinent. But this fantasy is historically flawed and strategically shortsighted. Nepal’s monarchy was never the steadfast Indian ally it is now nostalgically remembered as. After King Tribhuvan’s exile and return with Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru’s support in 1950, hopes for a constitutional monarchy in Nepal were high. Yet these hopes were quickly dashed. King Mahendra’s 1960 royal coup dismantled the nascent democracy, suppressed pro-India politicians, and aligned Nepal closer to China – a pattern that recurred with his son, King Gyanendra, during his 2005-08 power grab. Rather than strengthening ties with India, these monarchs often positioned themselves in opposition to Indian influence, using Hindu nationalism to consolidate internal power and assert sovereignty. Gyanendra’s regime, in particular, alienated New Delhi and created fertile ground for Chinese strategic inroads. Far from a stabilizing force, Nepal’s monarchy repeatedly proved to be a source of autocracy and diplomatic estrangement. The renewed royalist fervor in Nepal is often conflated with calls to re-establish a Hindu state. But not all supporters of a Hindu identity in Nepal support restoring the monarchy. The Nepali Congress, one of the country’s largest democratic parties, has formally endorsed the idea of a Hindu state, while opposing monarchical rule. This distinction is crucial. While monarchy implies authoritarian rule, calls for a Hindu state are more about cultural assertion – especially amid growing anxieties over federalism, secularism, and demographic change. Still, both narratives stem from widespread public frustration with Nepal’s current political system. Since the monarchy’s abolition in 2008, no elected government has completed a full term. Federalism, while progressive in theory, is seen by many Nepalis as creating more inefficiency and corruption, summed up in the popular quip: “Earlier we had one king, now we have 761.” This disillusionment is the fertile ground on which royalist and theocratic fantasies grow. The BJP-RSS establishment’s embrace of Nepal’s monarchists reflects more than strategic calculation; it is rooted in a shared ideological affinity for majoritarian nationalism and centralized religious authority. Figures like Yogi Adityanath – who symbolize the fusion of Hindu religiosity and political power – are seen by Nepal’s royalist right as aspirational models. The imagery of Adityanath at Nepal’s protests is a visual manifestation of this ideological export. Yet India’s historical actions have not always helped its image in Nepal. Two unofficial blockades – one in 1989 and another in 2015 – inflicted economic hardship and deepened resentment. Meanwhile, perceptions of Indian interference in Nepal’s domestic politics remain strong, further complicated by conspiracy theories (such as India's alleged role in the 2001 royal massacre) that, while baseless, are emotionally potent. These legacies have allowed China to position itself as a “non-interfering partner” and expand its footprint through infrastructure investments, soft power, and engagement with Nepal’s security apparatus. In contrast, India’s growing ideological alignment with monarchy risks alienating democratic forces within Nepal and undermining its long-term influence. Restoring a monarchy in Nepal won’t fix the structural issues that fuel instability: youth unemployment, rural poverty, and elite-driven governance. Over 4 million Nepalis now work abroad, and remittances equate to nearly 30 percent of GDP. Nepal’s economy remains heavily dependent on India, especially for trade, electricity, and transit infrastructure. India has made quiet but substantial investments in this sector – from the 900 MW Arun-III hydropower project to completed railway links like Jaynagar–Bardibas. Cross-border electricity transmission lines and the BBIN (Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal) initiative could position Nepal as a clean energy exporter in the region. These are the kinds of practical integrations that truly stabilize bilateral relations – not ideological posturing. Meanwhile, Nepal’s elected communist leaders – despite occasional anti-India rhetoric – have maintained functional ties with New Delhi. Leaders like Pushpa Kamal Dahal and current Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli may wave nationalist flags, but their electoral legitimacy requires ongoing engagement with India. Even critics of federalism are not necessarily calling for a return to monarchy, but rather for reforms that make democracy deliver. Ultimately, betting on monarchy is not a foreign policy strategy – it’s an ideological fantasy. If India wants to compete with China and maintain long-term influence in Nepal, it must invest in pluralism, economic cooperation, and democratic consolidation. The imagery of Yogi Adityanath in Kathmandu may excite some in Nagpur, but it alarms many in Nepal – and even more in India’s diplomatic community. India’s strength in South Asia has always come from its democratic model, not its imperial ambitions. Replacing that model with nostalgia for crowns and gods will only open the door further to adversaries who offer infrastructure without interference, and partnership without prescriptions.",

    "title": "Bonn Climate Talks Rife With Roadblocks and Dead Ends",
    "content": "As the United Nations climate talks came to a faltering end Thursday in Bonn, Germany, the world’s least developed countries and island nations feared for their future while some rich, developed countries backslid on climate promises and doubled down on fossil fuels.\n\nPreventing long-term warming of more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) above the pre-industrial level should remain the laser focus of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change talks, said Evans Njewa, chair of the United Nations group of Least Developed Countries.\n\n“As we gather here in Bonn, we remain nowhere near being on the path of 1.5 degrees Celsius,” he said. Science unequivocally shows that level of warming over pre-industrial temperatures, which was reached for the first full year in 2024, is a “climate emergency” that endangers lives and must be addressed, he added.\n\n“Every fraction of a degree matters to the group of least developed countries … home to more than 1 billion people on the front lines of the climate crisis,” he said, noting that those nations have done far less than developed nations to cause global warming. “We are already enduring the most devastating impacts, as shown by cyclones recently experienced in Malawi, Mozambique and Madagascar, floods across Nepal, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Uganda, and droughts that destroy or have destroyed millions of livelihoods.”\n\nDecrying the lack of progress at the annual talks, a coalition of more than 200 civil society and Indigenous groups delivered a letter to the UNFCCC on June 23, outlining ideas for reform, including ending what they see as corporate capture of the talks, ensuring more transparency in negotiations and putting human rights at the core of climate policy and action.\n\nThat puts climate policy squarely at an intersection with current political trends in some countries that are key to effective climate action, including the United States, where the new Republican administration is trying to dismantle climate policies established by the previous Democratic administration, and trying to enact other policies that would increase U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. The U.S. already emits about double the combined total greenhouse gas pollution of all 28 European Union countries, and is the single largest climate polluter in history.\n\nBut it’s not just the U.S. that’s backpedaling. New Zealand, under a conservative government elected in 2023, eased restrictions on offshore drilling for fossil fuels, and announced during the Bonn talks that it’s leaving the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance. That alliance was formed by a coalition of countries trying to collaborate on a higher level of climate action, in part as a response to the slow UNFCCC process. \n\nIn the European Union this week, mainstream conservative parties allied themselves with far-right nationalist parties to try and delay implementation of an important law that could help prevent tropical deforestation. And in Germany, a new conservative government has signaled that new spending on weapons may come at the expense of climate financing. \n\nMore Talk, More Emissions\n\nThe 11 days of talks in Bonn mark the halfway point between last year’s 29th Conference of the Parties climate gathering in Baku, Azerbaijan, and COP30 this November in Belém, Brazil. The intersessional talks take place annually and focus on the work of subsidiary technical groups that provide the nuts and bolts for how the various UNFCCC agreements and programs are implemented and monitored, laying the groundwork for the next COP summit.\n\nThis summer, the talks came during a sweltering heat dome in the United States and on the heels of Earth’s hottest years on record. A sudden temperature spike in 2023 and 2024 raised concerns about accelerated warming, and the growing likelihood of high-impact climate shifts that seemed nearly unthinkable just a few years ago, like a civilization-altering shutdown of a key heat-distributing Atlantic Ocean current.\n\nA few key areas of focus this year included finalizing a way to come up with the $1.3 trillion dollars in climate financing that was broadly agreed to at COP29 and finalizing a set of tools to measure the monitoring and effectiveness of climate adaptation measures. Countries were also prodded to submit more ambitious plans for emissions cuts via their voluntary Nationally Determined Contributions, the primary tool to limit warming under the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement.\n\nThe UNFCCC touted progress at the Bonn talks, including a new transparency framework for accountability in the Paris Agreement climate pledges. That enabled Panama to show how its ecosystems take up more carbon dioxide than the country emits, making it a net carbon sink. On the next-to-last day, many delegates said they see emerging solidarity on a key gender action plan, to be finalized at COP30 in Belém, that will spell out ways to effectively implement gender-responsive climate action.\n\nBut observers of the talks said there was not much progress on core issues, especially regarding finance, with some countries shifting spending priorities to weapons and other war materials. Recent elections and resulting policy changes in the United States and Germany, to name just a few, as well as the influence of far-right parties in the European Union, also made more ambitious emissions targets seem less likely in some key industrial countries that are among the world’s biggest historical climate polluters.\n\nTen Years After the Paris Pact\n\nDespite the current hurdles, UNFCCC Executive Secretary Simon Stiell said the world still has reason to celebrate the 10-year anniversary of the Paris Agreement. \n\n“Ten years ago, the Paris Agreement showed the world that multilateralism can deliver,” he said in a June 21 speech at the Bonn conference. “The prognosis was—and remains—clear: Without cooperation between nations, humanity was on a crash course for self-destruction.”\n\nHe said research shows that, without the Paris accord, the world would be on course for about 5 degrees Celsius (9 degrees Fahrenheit) of human-caused warming. \n\n“No nation, no economy, could survive that,” he said. “We’re now headed for around 3. It shows how far we’ve come, and how far we still have to go.”\n\nThat distance includes the gap between financial promises made and kept, said Anne Rasmussen, the lead climate negotiator for the Alliance of Small Island States, at a Tuesday press conference in Bonn.\n\n“AOSIS is bewildered by the backwards tracking on finance,” she said, adding that the UNFCCC member countries are obligated to implement the $1.3 billion climate finance package approved at COP29.\n\n“The discussions here in Bonn must be urgently progressed,” she said. “Climate change and its devastating impacts are accelerating. Why are we not acting at least apace?”\n\nShe said it’s easy to succumb to the “distraction and despair of international military conflicts, which are highlighted in the headlines,” but if “countries do not act with real ambition to achieve the pledges they made when we all committed to the Paris Agreement 10 years ago, we will be truly lost.”\n\nThe economies of small island states are stymied by climate disasters they did not cause, she said. Not even a year ago, she noted, the Caribbean was ravaged by Hurricane Beryl, the earliest Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic ever recorded and a storm that was super-charged by human-caused warming.\n\nRising Geoengineering Concerns in Africa\n\nThe backsliding on climate promises goes hand-in-hand with increasing talk about controversial and unproven climate-hacking schemes like intentionally polluting the stratosphere to reflect heat away from the planet, according to Hands Off Mother Earth, a nonprofit watchdog group that tries to track all types of geoengineering plans, policies and research around the planet.\n\nGeoengineering was not specifically itemized on the UNFCCC’s Bonn agenda, but showed up in various negotiations, as well as during side events during the talks, said Tamra Gilbertson, who tracked the Bonn talks for the Indigenous Environmental Network.\n\nShe said geoengineering oceans to absorb more carbon by adding mass quantities of certain minerals to their waters was discussed in formal sessions in the UNFCCC’s Ocean Dialogue, and in discussions about the carbon markets section of the Paris Agreement. “Proponents of ocean geoengineering pushed blue carbon, blue offsets, and the blue economy,” she wrote via email.\n\nWatchdog groups are concerned that the next round of national climate plans, which are due in November before COP30, could include geoengineering offsets as part of high-risk methods to mitigate global warming, which “raises red flags for land rights, Indigenous sovereignty, and environmental integrity,” she wrote.\n\nInternational climate justice groups are concerned that geoengineering plans are already being made without adequate engagement with the people who would be most affected, including Indigenous communities and developing countries in the Global South, and potentially in violation of existing international restrictions on climate hacking. \n\n“Geoengineering is a smokescreen that delays the urgent emissions cuts we need,” said Kwami Kpondzo, speaking at a June 24 press conference in Bonn on behalf of the Global Forest Coalition and as co-coordinator of the HOME Alliance Africa Working Group.\n\n“The very idea that African lands, skies and communities should be used to test risky technologies like solar radiation modification … is both unethical and unjust.”\n— Mfoniso Xael, Health of Mother Earth Foundation\n\nAs the number of outdoor geoengineering experiments grows, and as various countries establish research plans, Kpondzo said he’s concerned “the development of technologies is being quietly embedded into the UNFCCC process,” he said. “It is not a climate solution. It is a climate scam. It is colonialism in a new form.”\n\nAfrica has been proposed as a potential target area for some geoengineering plans, but those intentions may be misguided, said Mfoniso Xael, who tracked the Bonn talks for the Nigeria-based Health of Mother Earth Foundation.\n\n“The very idea that African lands, skies and communities should be used to test risky technologies like solar radiation modification, or what is now called manipulation, is both unethical and unjust,” she said.\n\nNot Africa, but the Global North, “through centuries of industrial emissions, land grabs and environmental destruction, is overwhelmingly responsible for the warming of our planet and the crisis that we face today,” she said. “Yet today, instead of cutting the emissions at the source, some of these same powerful actors are pushing unproven technologies, technologies that interfere with the Earth system, onto Africa.”\n\nSome scientists, including well-respected climate experts like James Hansen, have said geoengineering should at least be well-researched to preserve options for future generations, but Dylan Hamilton, with the Alliance of Non-Governmental Radical Youth, said many young people don’t see a future that includes geoengineering. \n\n“There is no future that includes fossil fuel expansion,” he said. “There is no future that includes the same capitalist and colonial systems of exploitation. There is no future where commodifying our planet will somehow save it.” \n\nInstead, Hamilton said, “solutions will come from dismantling our extractive economy, redistributing power and centering those who are most impacted in this fight for a livable future.”",

    "title": "How carbon capture works and the debate about whether it’s a future climate solution",
    "content": "By TAMMY WEBBER, Associated Press\n\nPower plants and industrial facilities that emit carbon dioxide, the primary driver of global warming, are hopeful that Congress will keep tax credits for capturing the gas and storing it deep underground.\n\nThe process, called carbon capture and sequestration, is seen by many as an important way to reduce pollution during a transition to renewable energy.\n\nBut it faces criticism from some conservatives, who say it is expensive and unnecessary, and from environmentalists, who say it has consistently failed to capture as much pollution as promised and is simply a way for producers of fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal to continue their use.\n\nHere’s a closer look:\n\nHow does the process work?\n\nCarbon dioxide is a gas produced by burning of fossil fuels. It traps heat close to the ground when released to the atmosphere, where it persists for hundreds of years and raises global temperatures.\n\nIndustries and power plants can install equipment to separate carbon dioxide from other gases before it leaves the smokestack. The carbon then is compressed and shipped — usually through a pipeline — to a location where it’s injected deep underground for long-term storage.\n\nCarbon also can be captured directly from the atmosphere using giant vacuums. Once captured, it is dissolved by chemicals or trapped by solid material.\n\nLauren Read, a senior vice president at BKV Corp., which built a carbon capture facility in Texas, said the company injects carbon at high pressure, forcing it almost two miles below the surface and into geological formations that can hold it for thousands of years.\n\nThe carbon can be stored in deep saline or basalt formations and unmineable coal seams. But about three-fourths of captured carbon dioxide is pumped back into oil fields to build up pressure that helps extract harder-to-reach reserves — meaning it’s not stored permanently, according to the International Energy Agency and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nHow much carbon dioxide is captured?\n\nThe most commonly used technology allows facilities to capture and store around 60% of their carbon dioxide emissions during the production process. Anything above that rate is much more difficult and expensive, according to the IEA.\n\nSome companies have forecast carbon capture rates of 90% or more, “in practice, that has never happened,” said Alexandra Shaykevich, research manager at the Environmental Integrity Project’s Oil & Gas Watch.\n\nThat’s because it’s difficult to capture carbon dioxide from every point where it’s emitted, said Grant Hauber, a strategic adviser on energy and financial markets at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.\n\nEnvironmentalists also cite potential problems keeping it in the ground. For example, last year, agribusiness company Archer-Daniels-Midland discovered a leak about a mile underground at its Illinois carbon capture and storage site, prompting the state legislature this year to ban carbon sequestration above or below the Mahomet Aquifer, an important source of drinking water for about a million people.\n\nCarbon capture can be used to help reduce emissions from hard-to-abate industries like cement and steel, but many environmentalists contend it’s less helpful when it extends the use of coal, oil and gas.\n\nA 2021 study also found the carbon capture process emits significant amounts of methane, a potent greenhouse gas that’s shorter-lived than carbon dioxide but traps over 80 times more heat. That happens through leaks when the gas is brought to the surface and transported to plants.\n\nAbout 45 carbon-capture facilities operated on a commercial scale last year, capturing a combined 50 million metric tons of carbon dioxide — a tiny fraction of the 37.8 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide emissions from the energy sector alone, according to the IEA.\n\nIt’s an even smaller share of all greenhouse gas emissions, which amounted to 53 gigatonnes for 2023, according to the latest report from the European Commission’s Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research.\n\nThe Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis says one of the world’s largest carbon capture utilization and storage projects, ExxonMobil’s Shute Creek facility in Wyoming, captures only about half its carbon dioxide, and most of that is sold to oil and gas companies to pump back into oil fields.\n\nFuture of US tax credits is unclear\n\nEven so, carbon capture is an important tool to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, particularly in heavy industries, said Sangeet Nepal, a technology specialist at the Carbon Capture Coalition.\n\n“It’s not a substitution for renewables … it’s just a complementary technology,” Nepal said. “It’s one piece of a puzzle in this broad fight against the climate change.”\n\nExperts say many projects, including proposed ammonia and hydrogen plants on the U.S. Gulf Coast, likely won’t be built without the tax credits, which Carbon Capture Coalition Executive Director Jessie Stolark says already have driven significant investment and are crucial U.S. global competitiveness.\n\nThey remain in the Senate Finance Committee’s draft reconciliation bill, after another version passed the House, though the Carbon Capture Coalition said inflation has already slashed their value and could limit projects.\n\nAssociated Press reporter Jack Brook in New Orleans contributed to this report.\n\nThe Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

That happens through leaks when the gas is brought to the surface and transported to plants.\n\nAbout 45 carbon-capture facilities operated on a commercial scale last year, capturing a combined 50 million metric tons of carbon dioxide — a tiny fraction of the 37.8 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide emissions from the energy sector alone, according to the IEA.\n\nIt's an even smaller share of all greenhouse gas emissions, which amounted to 53 gigatonnes for 2023, according to the latest report from the European Commission’s Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research.\n\nThe Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis says one of the world's largest carbon capture utilization and storage projects, ExxonMobil’s Shute Creek facility in Wyoming, captures only about half its carbon dioxide, and most of that is sold to oil and gas companies to pump back into oil fields.\n\nFuture of US tax credits is unclear\n\nEven so, carbon capture is an important tool to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, particularly in heavy industries, said Sangeet Nepal, a technology specialist at the Carbon Capture Coalition.\n\n“It’s not a substitution for renewables ... it’s just a complementary technology,” Nepal said. “It’s one piece of a puzzle in this broad fight against the climate change.”\n\nExperts say many projects, including proposed ammonia and hydrogen plants on the U.S. Gulf Coast, likely won't be built without the tax credits, which Carbon Capture Coalition Executive Director Jessie Stolark says already have driven significant investment and are crucial U.S. global competitiveness.\n\nThey remain in the Senate Finance Committee's draft reconciliation bill, after another version passed the House, though the Carbon Capture Coalition said inflation has already slashed their value and could limit projects.",

    "content": "Kathmandu [Nepal], June 26 (ANI): A Special Court in Nepal has ordered the release of former Nepali Prime Minister Madhav Kumar Nepal on bail amounting to NRS 3.5 million in the Patanjali land scam case.\nIt was the first time that a Prime Minister had been booked for corruption in the Himalayan Nation. The bail order was issued on Wednesday following the conclusion of his statement and detention hearing in the corruption case filed by the Nepali Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA).\nAlso Read | Donald Trump Claims He Prevented India-Pakistan Nuclear War Through Trade Deals (Watch Video).\nA bench comprising Special Court members Tej Narayan Singh Raya, Ram Bahadur Thapa, and Bidur Koirala issued the order directing his release on bail.\nSenior Advocate Sushil Pant, on Wednesday, hired by the CIAA, led the prosecution, which also included government attorneys Mohan Sagar Basyal, Bhagawati Devi Gautam, Umakanta Poudel, and Gyan Prasad Bhusal.\nAlso Read | Donald Trump Meets With Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Says Higher NATO Defence Spending May Deter Future Russian Aggression.\nPant argued that the Cabinet decision enabling the land transaction constituted corruption and should not exempt Nepal from legal accountability.\nPant responded to two key questions posed by the court - whether the CIAA can prosecute a policy-level Cabinet decision and whether Nepal's role caused harm to government property, as the land in question had not been officially nationalised.\nPant contended that it was not a policy decision and that the land swap effectively caused a loss to the government, as the land beyond the ownership ceiling was meant to be compulsorily nationalised, thereby resulting in a loss. Pant stressed that Nepal should be held in custody during the trial.\nThe defence, led by Senior Advocate Shambhu Thapa, challenged the CIAA's legal standing in the case, arguing that independent lawyers cannot represent the prosecution when the charge sheet specifies government attorneys.\nThapa cited precedent from 2003 in which a similar land exemption decision was upheld by the Supreme Court and claimed the charges against the former Nepali PM were politically motivated and legally baseless.\nOther defence lawyers, including Khamma Bahadur Khati, Raman Shrestha and Gobinda Bandi, supported the claim that the Cabinet's decision was policy-driven and beyond the CIAA's jurisdiction.\nEarlier on June 5, the CIAA had booked the former Prime Minister in a corruption case for the first time in the nation's history.\nThe case involves alleged misappropriation of land acquired for Patanjali Yogpeeth in Nepal under government exemptions for land ownership ceilings.\nAs per the charges, the anti-grant agency has demanded NRS 186 million from the former Prime Minister.\nMadhav Kumar Nepal, now the chairman of CPN-Unified Socialist (CPN-US), while in power on February 1, 2010, had approved the purchase of 815 ropani (one ropani equals 0.0509 hectares) of land in Banepa, Kavre, under the ceiling exemption for purposes including yoga centres, Ayurvedic institutes, and the herbal industry. The decision was made through a meeting of the council of ministers led by then Prime Minister Madhav Kumar Nepal.\nThe same cabinet meeting also approved the purchase of land under a ceiling exemption of 75 bighas (one bigha equals 0.677 hectares) in Dang, 300 ropanis in Lamjung, 250 ropanis in Syangja, 15 bighas in Chitwan, 25 bighas in Dhanusha, 150 ropanis in the Kathmandu Valley, and 40 bighas in the Bara-Parsa area within five years.\nAfter receiving Cabinet approval, Patanjali's Nepal chief, Shaligram Singh, purchased 593 ropanis, 5 annas, and 3 paisas of land in the areas of Nasikasthan, Sanga, Mahendrajyoti, and Chalal Ganeshsthan in Banepa.\nThe decision-making process to grant approval for purchasing land under the ceiling exemption involved then Prime Minister Madhav Kumar Nepal, then Land Reform Minister Dambar Shrestha, then chief secretary Madhav Ghimire, then secretary Chhabiraj Pant, along with other high-ranking officials and employees.\nWithin a month of receiving approval to purchase land under the ceiling exemption, on February 19, 2010, Patanjali's Nepal chief Shaligram, submitted an application to the then Land Reform Minister, Shrestha, seeking permission to sell the land acquired under the exemption.\nOn March 16 of the same year, citing \"as per Prime Minister Nepal's instruction\", then Minister Shrestha took the proposal to the Cabinet to allow Patanjali to sell the land obtained through the ceiling exemption. Three days later, the Cabinet decided to approve the sale of the exempted land.\nHowever, on March 30, 2010, then-director general of the Land Reform Department Keshar Bahadur Baniya sent a letter to the ministry stating that the Cabinet's decision was illegal and could not be implemented.\nOn April 8, 2010, the Cabinet decided to seek clarification from Director General Baniya, accusing him of challenging the approval given for the sale of land exempted from the land ceiling. The next day, to support the planned sale of the exempted land, Baniya was allegedly removed from his position as director general, and Joint Secretary Jit Bahadur Thapa of the ministry was appointed in his place.\nOn the very same day he assumed the role, Thapa sent a letter to the Kavre Land Revenue Office granting approval for the sale of the land exempted from the land ceiling.\nOn June 25, 2010, Patanjali sold 353 ropani and 15 aana of land to Kasthamandap Business Homes Pvt Ltd. The investigation has also revealed financial irregularities in land transactions.\nWhen Patanjali sold the land in Banepa, the recorded price was NRS 42.25 million. Government records show that Patanjali later bought 104 ropani, one aana, two paisa, and one dam of land in Dhulikhel for Rs 10.75 million.

    "title": "Nepal’s forest user groups are fighting climate change from the ground up",
    "content": "At a time when women are bearing the brunt of climate change across all sectors, more than 20,000 Community Forest User Groups (CFUG) in Nepal are raising funds from a wide array of sources to support climate change mitigation and adaptation initiatives.Many of these women-led forest groups are restoring degraded lands through plantations, adopting agroforestry practices, preparing climate-smart operational plans, promoting forest foods, conserving water bodies, preventing forest fires, implementing soil conservation measures to combat erosion and introducing sustainable forest management strategies, among other efforts.The main source of revenue for CFUGs is mainly the sale of goods and services derived from forest resources, payments for ecosystem services, membership fees and fines imposed for breaches of rules, said Sita Aryal, the executive director of Federation of Community Forestry Users Nepal (FECOFUN), a formal network of these groups. “CFUGs also receive financial support in the form of grants from various levels of government as well as from national and international non-profits,” she said.However, in recent years, women-led grassroots organisations have remained severely underfunded when it comes to climate financing, according to a study by Rights and Resources, a global coalition of organisations. This is particularly the case for Indigenous peoples, local communities, Afro-descendant groups and women’s associations across the Global South engaged in climate action..Managing forest resources.Across Nepal, CFUGs operate autonomously under their own operational plans. The evolution of community forestry in this small Himalayan country is a complex story of integration between social, political and environmental goals.Community involvement in Nepal’s forestry sector began in the late 1970s, when the government acknowledged the ecological and administrative failures of a centralised forest management system, including increased deforestation, soil erosion and other environmental concerns in hilly areas. This prompted a series of reforms, starting with the Panchayat Forest Rules of 1978, which aimed to devolve forest management responsibilities to communities.“This was officially the beginning of what has now grown to be one of the largest community forestry initiatives in the world,” Aryal said. The Forest Act of 1993 cemented this shift by granting user rights over government forests to local communities, provided they adhered to government-approved management plans.The first CFUGs were formed in 1989 and recognised as autonomous, self-governing bodies. These groups were empowered to manage, use and distribute forest resources while retaining revenues from forest activities. By the late 1990s, Nepal’s community forestry model had garnered international recognition.Since then, the programme has expanded significantly, with an increased focus on marginalised communities, particularly women, in leadership and decision-making roles. Today, 23,026 CFUGs are affiliated with FECOFUN, encompassing 3.19 million households and protecting more than 2.4 million hectares of forest.Kumar Paudel, founder and director of Greenhood Nepal, a non-profit focused on wildlife, noted that although women’s leadership in forestry is growing, they still lag behind in decision-making roles. “There is a need for more women leaders in community forestry and conservation, as female leadership has proven both effective and efficient,” he said. “Women leading community forests is encouraging. It also serves as a valuable platform for leadership development that can prepare them for higher-level conservation roles in future.”In India, women’s participation in forest management has yielded positive results in parts of Odisha’s Nayagarh district, where women regularly patrol forests to prevent fires and deter timber smugglers. In the late 1990s, when men failed to protect surrounding forest areas, women stepped in. Their participation is essential, as they depend heavily on forests for firewood and food..Impact of these groups and parallels with India.To strengthen the rights of forest dwellers over forest resources, India enacted the Forest Rights Act (FRA) in 2006. The provision for Community Forest Resource Rights (CFRR) under the FRA mandates that forest governance and protection be carried out by local communities. However, reporting from several tribal villages in Chhattisgarh found that many women remained excluded from decision-making processes and many were unaware of the FRA. That said, a few single women noted they had benefitted from receiving individual land titles under the Act.According to independent researcher Tushar Dash, the FRA provides a strong legal framework to recognise the rights of forest-dwelling communities over community forest resources.Aryal noted that under community management, Nepal’s forests have shown signs of recovery, with improved biodiversity. “Community forestry has been linked to enhanced socio-economic outcomes for rural communities, especially women and marginalised groups, by ensuring access to vital forest products such as timber, firewood, fodder and medicinal plants,” she said.But the road has not been without challenges. In India too, communities are pushing for more control under CFRR, despite the continued presence of Joint Forest Management Committees (JFMC), which some FRA experts argue should be disbanded.While CFUGs in Nepal have gained global attention for their climate mitigation efforts, questions remain around equitable benefit-sharing among participants. Aryal acknowledged that the social diversity within CFUGs can complicate governance, as internal hierarchies and power dynamics sometimes lead to conflicts among different socio-economic groups.In Nepal, the future of community forestry hinges on striking a balance between local needs and broader environmental and economic goals. In India, the success of CFRR under the FRA will similarly depend on greater community engagement, particularly of women, in regions affected by conflict. In such areas, the presence of military camps and armed guards around mining zones often restricts forest access. Some organisations, such as PRADAN, are working to boost women’s participation in implementing the FRA..Read all the news related to forests in Hindi",

    "content": "Kathmandu [Nepal], June 25 (ANI): The commercial production of methane gas in western Nepal is expected to begin next fiscal year, Nepal Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli announced, with further study still pending in the region for the gas production.\nThe announcement made by Nepal's Prime Minister on Tuesday came ahead of a detailed report on the site of the gas production, which is expected to be published by the end of the year.\nAlso Read | Donald Trump Nominated for Nobel Peace Prize for His Role in Israel-Iran Ceasefire and Preventing Tehran From Acquiring Nuclear Weapons.\nLast week, a preliminary study in the area estimated 1.12 billion cubic meters of natural gas in the Dailekh district of Western Nepal, which is yet to be studied in detail.\nThe Department of Mines and Geology of Nepal made the announcement last week based on a geological survey conducted by the China Geological Survey and exploratory drilling by CNPC Xibu Drilling Engineering Company, a Chinese state-owned firm.\nAlso Read | Iran Military Commander Ali Fadavi Arrested for Spying for Israel? Know Truth As Rumours Go Viral.\nIn the initial report, the Chinese state-owned firm had indicated the presence of methane gas at the Jaljale site, with findings suggesting it could supply Nepal's gas demand for the next 50 years.\n\"The trial production (of methane gas) will start within Mangsir (November), and its commercial production will possibly start within the next fiscal year. It will be utilised fully,\" the Nepalese Prime Minister announced during Tuesday's parliamentary meeting.\nThe Chinese company, which previously drilled to a depth of 4,013 meters and extracted a one-meter core sample for laboratory testing, will proceed with further steps only after intergovernmental agreements are in place, officials said on condition of anonymity.\nThe Chinese team had collected rock samples and transported them to China for further testing to determine the quantity and quality of the methane gas. Based on current estimates, the discovered methane reserves could meet Nepal's energy needs for the next 50 years, marking a potential breakthrough in reducing the country's dependence on petroleum products.\nThe exploration was initiated under a bilateral agreement signed between the governments of Nepal and China in 2016, aimed at developing petroleum resources.\nIn 2019, Nepal's Department of Mines and Geology entered into a formal agreement worth NPR 2.4 billion with the China Geological Survey for exploration and drilling work. However, progress was delayed due to several challenges, including the COVID-19 pandemic, transportation issues, road access limitations, and land acquisition disputes.\nThe three-year agreement, signed in February 2019, was later extended in 2022. Drilling was carried out on 45 ropani (approximately 2.29 hectares) of acquired land in Jaljale by a team of around 70 technicians, while the project also provided employment to about 100 local workers.\nMethane (CH4), composed of hydrogen and carbon, is a cleaner-burning fuel compared to petrol or diesel. It is a potent greenhouse gas, formed primarily through the decomposition of organic matter over long periods.\nGlobally, methane is used as an energy source for heating, electricity generation, and industrial applications. Unlike liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), it cannot be easily compressed into small household cylinders and is typically stored in larger containers.
